Your goal is to analyze the provided content and create **three diverse, meaningful, and answerable questions** that reflect the key ideas, findings, or insights from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "        However, **do not generate questions** if the text primarily consists of irrelevant or low-value content such as:\n",

      "Question: What are the potential benefits of using NFTs as a marketing tool for hotels, and how can they enhance guest experiences?\n",
      "Answer: The potential benefits of using NFTs as a marketing tool for hotels include boosting brand awareness by creating and trading NFTs related to hotel intellectual property, enhancing guest experiences through interactive digital art, and crowdfund development ventures. Hotels can also use NFTs to connect with their audience, deliver meanings and messages of experiences, and support brand-related causes. This can lead to increased engagement and loyalty among customers. \n",

In summary, the \\ncore of the Semantic Engine is the FHIR knowledge graph; \\nthe peripheral consists of attribute nodes in the local data-\\nsets. The correspondents between the FHIR resource nodes \\nand local attribute nodes are connected by ‘mapping’ lines. \\nDue to the fact that attribute nodes are defined by local \\nimplementors, it is difficult to name nodes consistently, \\nwhich may lead to ambiguity.\\nThe query statements sent by clients to the Semantic \\nEngine reflect their understanding of the FHIR specifica-\\ntion through the lexical approach.
