ABSTRACT Since Facebook was renamed Meta, a lot of attention, debate, and exploration have intensified about what the Metaverse is, how it works, and the possible ways to exploit it. It is anticipated that Metaverse will be a continuum of rapidly emerging technologies, usecases, capabilities, and experiences that will make it up for the next evolution of the Internet. Several researchers have already surveyed the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications in realizing the Metaverse. However, due to the rapid emergence and continuous evolution of technologies, there is a need for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of the role of AI, 6G, and the nexus of both in realizing the immersive experiences of Metaverse. Therefore, in this survey, we first introduce the background and ongoing progress in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR) and spatial computing, followed by the technical aspects of AI and 6G. Then, we survey the role of AI in the Metaverse by reviewing the state-of-the-art in deep learning, computer vision, and Edge AI to extract the requirements of 6G in Metaverse. Next, we investigate the promising services of B5G/6G towards Metaverse, followed by identifying the role of AI in 6G networks and 6G networks for AI in support of Metaverse applications, and the need for sustainability in Metaverse. Finally, we enlist the existing and potential applications, usecases, and projects to highlight the importance of progress in the Metaverse. Moreover, in order to provide potential research directions to researchers, we underline the challenges, research gaps, and lessons learned identified from the literature review of the aforementioned technologies. INDEX TERMS Metaverse, 5G, 6G, AI, cloud and edge computing, AR/VR/XR, spatial computing. I N , Metaverse started influencing the real-world due to: i) pandemic lifestyle, and ii) the announcements of Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (MAANG) to release Metaverse-related features and projects for their users. Since then, Metaverse has sought sheer attention ©  The Authors. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives . License.

At the current point in time, the Metaverse can be generally viewed as a pool of extended reality (XR) spaces in which humans and their digital counterparts interact in a fully immersive manner [], [], [], []. According to a recent survey, the majority of technology experts believe that by  the Metaverse will be more refined and seamless in its operation so that people around the world will be able to fully engage immersion capabilities as an integral part of their daily lives. In essence, Metaverse is anticipated to integrate all essential aspects of cyberspace or the world wide Web, such as B5G/6G, cloud and edge computing, social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), cryptocurrencies, and artificial (AI)/machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) platforms and applications, to allow users to interact virtually [], [], Some of the early stage applications of Metaverse, namely Roblox, VRChat, Zepeto5 or Second Life6 have been allowing users to live in “different” or simulated lives, such as making friends and socializing with new avatars. These platforms have incorporated AR, VR and MR as a few elements of the Metaverse. The VR technology replaces the real world around users with a computer-generated digital scene using various software and communication devices, such as a head-mounted display (HMD). While in AR, the virtual world is seamlessly connected with the real world in order to create new interactive experiences. Finally, MR emerges as the combination of AR and VR and their underlying technologies. It is also noteworthy to mention that the popularity of these technologies has led to the universal availability of AR and VR equipment at reasonable prices while continually improving the quality of experience (QoE) However, in order to achieve the processing power and communication speed that are required by VR services to deliver smooth and immersive experiences, most HMDs still require the users to be tethered to a PC or gaming console. The only device to break free from this cable constraint is Meta’s Oculus Quest . Over the next few years, a number of improvements will be made to visual content and the untethered experience of mobile devices as processors get faster and wireless communication technologies to become latency-free. In particular, with the existence of 5G, there will be a proliferation of devices connected to the network, which will have a profound impact on the growth of Metaverse []. 5G has enabled real-time communication and information exchange among all of the connected devices with its low . Note that important acronyms are defined in Table . . https://www.pewresearch.org/internet////the-Metaverse-in- . https://store.facebook.com/ie/quest/products/quest-/ latency. It is evident that 5G offers faster speeds than 4G, but most importantly, it offers a variety of other benefits that go beyond speed alone []. Specifically, Metaverse developers will be able to benefit from 5G’s low latency by creating applications that can transmit ◦ content in near real-time. Metaverse will also proliferate the trend of human- centric/data-centric intelligent systems. This trend poses a number of constraints on existing 5G communication systems, making them less efficient and unreliable. For example, considering the .1ms delay requirements of haptic-based Metaverse applications such as teleportation or teleoperations, 5G can only provide the air interface latency of <1ms, which becomes inconsiderable for such applications [], [], [], []. Moreover, according to Cisco [], mobile data traffic has grown -fold over the past five years and is expected to continue to grow. % of the total mobile traffic in the world. 5G networks were designed to be able to cover spectrum, such as millimeter-waves (up to  GHz), and as a result, can handle large quantities of wireless traffic Since Metaverse will bring several applications that may require data rates that are higher than Tbps, which is not likely to be the case with mmWave systems, such as holo- graphic telepresence (HT), haptic sensory communications, brain-computer interface (BCI), and XR [], [], []. As a result, researchers have resorted to exploring the Terahertz (THz) frequency band (.- THz) in order to achieve the objectives of Tbps data rates. 6G communi- cation system is expected to provide 1Tbps of data rates, operating at 3Thz of bandwidth in order to support data- intensive applications such as online gaming, live streaming of high definition videos, the transmission of holographic content, and real-time avatar interactions [], [], [], []. 6G will also provide ubiquitous coverage and ultra- low latency (less than 1ms) as well as support around  km/hour mobility by integrating the space-air-ground- Nevertheless, Metaverse applications such as virtual edu- cation and training, precise navigation and localization, immersive gaming, and remote healthcare applications would all be enabled by AI and 6G, making the Metaverse more successful. In particular, state-of-the-art in computer vision can be utilized to provide animated 3D human models or realistic animated faces, and even for the creation of holograms [], [], []. However, the key challenge in utilizing the 3D content for Metaverse services lies in the scalability of the existing infrastructure. Therefore, the rise and infrastructure to enable Metaverse developers to build better and more scalable 3D/AR/VR experiences, regardless of platforms or purposes. In principle, researchers need to take a leap from the supervised learning paradigm of to diversified learning strategies such as reinforcement learning and self-supervised learning in order ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE TABLE . List of important acronyms. to scale in a Metaverse environment. Moreover, the edge computing capabilities of 6G networks can be combined with the AI to provide edge intelligence, hence reducing the network delays and privacy issues for enhanced QoE in Metaverse []. Motivated by the existing technologies and foreseen challenges, we survey the state-of-the-art in AI and 6G in the context of Metaverse to answer the following question: how to provide a better and sustainable Metaverse experience by leveraging the ongoing progress in AI, 6G, and the nexus of both? In the following subsections, we review the related surveys and outline the contribution and structure In this subsection, we review the state-of-the-art surveys con- ducted on several technologies in the context of Metaverse. Recently, there has been many surveys and research studies conducted to investigate the potential technology, its imple- mentation, applications, and future research directions [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []. For example, Yang et al., [] investigate the integrated role of AI and Blockchain for the Metaverse environments. In particular, authors in [] propose that all aspects of social and economic activities and allows everyone to participate in these activities in a safe and free environment that transcends the limitations of our real world by making use of AI and blockchain technology. Similarly, [] and [] surveys the security and privacy concerns for Metaverse users and proposes potential directions to provide secure services to Metaverse users. On the other hand, researchers in [], [], [] investigate the role of AI in the Metaverse. In particular, [] surveys the existing state-of-the-art in AI, computer vision, and deep learning in the context of Metaverse, while [] and [] explore the role of edge intelligence and 6G-powered edge AI for Metaverse, respectively. In contrast, authors in [], [], [], [] scrutinize the wireless communication architectures and technologies in support of Metaverse.

AI AND 6G FOR METAVERSE: BACKGROUND AND This section of the article will provide a detailed account of the background on the metaverse from the point of view of technical analysis. The term “Metaverse” is a com- the prefix “meta” (meaning “beyond”) and the suffix “verse” (short for “universe”). As a result, refers to a universe beyond the physical world. This “uni- verse beyond” alludes to a computer-generated environment instead of metaphysical or mystical notions of domains beyond the physical reality []. Metaverses are fully immer- sive three-dimensional digital environments, as opposed to cyberspace, which refers to all online spaces. We provide a critical evaluation of AI and the Metaverse in this sec- tion and some essential prerequisites for understanding the Metaverse 6G prospects []. This comprehensive overview will cover the fundamental algorithms, current and future product applications. We take a brief introduction to AI, which constructed a sophisticated black- box for high-level tasks such as detection and classification. The Metaverse role is then conducted to investigate what the Metaverse requires of AI key stakeholders for more trustworthy communications []. A. DEFINITION OF METAVERSE BASED ON AI AND 6G Metaverse is an advanced digital realm that incorporates artificial intelligence and 6G technology to provide users with highly realistic, personalized, and interactive experi- ences. A highly immersive shared environment is created by combining artificial intelligence with ultra-fast and low- latency wireless communication to create dynamic virtual environments. Metaverse allows users to participate in activi- ties such as shopping, gaming, and socializing. It also allows users to explore virtual universes, create virtual objects, and customize their avatars. Metaverse is revolutionizing the way people interact with technology and is the future of virtual interaction. It is predicted to have a huge economic impact in the coming years. Metaverse is also poised to revolutionize the way we work, allowing people to work remotely and collaborate more effectively. It is also expected to create new opportunities for people to earn a living, as well as enable businesses to reach a wider audience. B. THE BACKGROUND OF AI FOR METAVERSE This section explain the background of metaverse. The metaverse incorporates numerous technologies such as 3D animation, VR, AR, spatial computing, blockchain, and many more hot technologies [], []. It is the next technological future from a socioeconomic standpoint. Many enterprises have already devoted significant resources to Metaverse initiatives to give new digital services to the globe and be the first to deliver metaverse landscapes. Why do we say metaverse is the hottest technological and socioeconomic topic right now? Take the example of Facebook, which changed its name to Meta from Facebook, demonstrating that the metaverse will be the next big mainstream technology for industries. The future of Internet in metaverse will be a large-scaled, resilient, dynamic, and platform for socializing, trading, transferring data, and entertaining people in real- time. Hitherto, a lot of effort was made on Web1 and Web2 []. Web1 was guided on browsing plain online pages, whereas Web2 explained how to connect to social platforms within controlled ecosystems. In the metaverse, NFTs will take the place of digital ownership in an open, decentralized environment []. This will enable people to link digitally with the rest of the world and generate a healthy economy in which people can execute any work that can be performed in the physical world. Much has been said about the Internet and its future, but it is vital to distinguish between the metaverse and Web3. Web3 is about applying advanced digital services, but being controlled by large technology corporations as in these services will be created and governed by the community, returning to the ethos of Web1, when the Internet’s value was generated by users at the network’s edge, predominantly in a forward mode. Virtual worlds, massive scalability, persistence, synchronicity, a functional economy, openness and decentralization, interoperability, and so on should all be included in a Metaverse platform []. The metaverse begins to make artificial intelligence (AI) more ubiquitous in reality, which will power numerous metaverse technology layers such as spatial computing, artist scaffolding, and new emerging types of storytelling. We have seen that AI is advancing at a comparable level, such as transformers; transformers are neural networks that allow TABLE .

An empirical study of the Internet invasion of the metaverse is presented in the timeline revolution in metaverse. machines to interact with natural language, and the graph below shows the exponential expansion of deep learning transformers [], []. In Figure , we show how Growth of Deep Leaning Transformers from  to . The idea of the metaverse has seen a surge in popularity in recent years, emerging closely following the advent of the Internet. Figure  illustrates key milestones in the metaverse’s evolution, ranging from the seminal development of the Internet in  to the establishment of the first virtual world, Second Life, in . More recently, major technology companies have embarked on notable metaverse initiatives, marking significant strides in this evolving digital realm. Consider the following transformers: the Generative parameters; the newest Google Brain transformer dealt with over  trillion parameters. GPT- will most likely have far more. This suggests that the volume of DNN networks will continue to grow in the future. With the advancement of neural networks, AI has already achieved a lot of success in voice recognition in Alexa, Tesla’s autonomous driving system, Google image recognition, and a few algorithms that elicit reactions from social media and deep fakes; however, all of these applications are just basic in comparison to AI’s future applications [], [].

These can be accessed over the Internet via smartphones and wristband technology. People will play, learn, create, shop, and communicate with friends in a virtual, online world. Today, the Metaverse is emerging as metaphysics, or, as we might say, the transformation of the universe. In the past two years, we have seen that with the covid epidemic, digital technologies shift their waves quickly, and it has FIGURE . Growth of Deep Learning Transformers from  to . FIGURE . Application and infrastructure-level machine learning and deep learning been in the past as well. The 1980s saw the rise of computers, the 1990s saw the rise of the Internet, the 2000s saw the rise of mobile Internet, of AI/ML/DL/Data analytics [], and the 2020s saw the rise of true AI/Trans-AI/Meta-AI. The Metaverse, transverse, or omniverse could be the next wave. The waves are now merging, such as the Internet on PCs, on mobile devices, and AI/ML on the mobile Internet. The Metaverse will demand the Internet, mobile devices, and REAL AI. A Metaverse contains simulated AR, VR, MR [], [], [], [], [], [], [], a 3D World Wide Web, and other forms of digital twins, including digital humans as intelligent avatars. Metaverse will function as a real-time digital environment containing all feasible entities, occurrences, activities, and interactions. Currently, trillions of dollars are being invested in Metaverse projects like AI- driven digital reality to offer a digital infrastructure that can accommodate all of its social media networks, e-commerce, and big tech oligopoly []. We risk creating a Matrix-like Metaverse of digitized humans and superintelligent agents as a virtual world where young people can transcend the meaningless reality of the real world in which they live. The Metaverse is a virtual reality that integrates all essential aspects of cyberspace or the world wide Web, such as cloud and edge computing, social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) [], [], cryptocurrencies [], and AI/ML/DL platforms [] and applications, to allow users to interact virtually. Everything we use anyway, such as video conferencing, games, email, mixed reality, e-commerce, social media, and Netflix/YT live-streaming, are all part of the Metaverse. For many MMOG gamers, the Metaverse, defined as the Internet filled with mixed, virtual, and augmented worlds, is more real than any physical reality. It is as real as its technological solutions, which include social media, virtual world games, extended reality, simulation and modeling, human-computer interaction, digital twin, machine learning and reasoning, data analytics, computer vision, edge and cloud computing, and mobile networks, all of which are powered by true AI Metaverse technology. Using machine learning and deep learning, we have demonstrated the detailed involvement of the metaverse in 6G technologies in Figure . Spatial computing is the digitalization of machine, human, and object activities and the locations in which they occur to facilitate and improve actions and interactions. Spatial computing is the seamless integration of three technolo- gies: augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) in a three-dimensional world [], []. This technology can digitally revolutionize how industrial organizations optimize operations for in factories, work areas, and logistics. Spatial computing technology is analogous to the commonwealth of the physical and digital worlds. This means that almost all people no longer interact with computers in the fashion that an impartial observer should; conversely, they choose to encounter what it is really like to be in the digital domain by associating with elements that only reside in it. In contrast to traditional computing, which is predominantly two-dimensional, spatial computing allows users to think out of communicate with gadgets from above the screen. The innumerable devices are already on the marketplace for spatial computing. Here are a few examples: VR Headsets, AR Glasses, and Hybrid Gear are all examples of cutting- edge technology []. Whereas VR headsets enable visitors to explore being a part of a virtual universe, AR Glasses allow individuals to go greater depth into the digital space, and Hybrid Gear combines VR, AR, and MR technology. Since the user may fully integrate their senses, this program enables them to enjoy a cinematic experience. In the past, gamers adopted VR headsets to interact with video game items and avatars. Their application has recently expanded to encompass additional applications such as training and modeling. AR Glasses are gadgets that project data and visu- als and are particularly beneficial in industrial workplaces. Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens are two special AR ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE FIGURE .

FellReal’s multi-sensory mask is an excellent example of such technology. While such merchandise is still in the works, major tech corporations like Samsung, Google, Apple, and Microsoft invest in startups to create cutting-edge hybrid tools and equipment. By showing how the physical world will be transformed into the digital world via the rise of Metaverse, we demonstrate in Figure  how technologies such as enabling technologies will play a significant role. The ultimate advantage of spatial computing is the ability to interact with digital objects. It provides extra privileges that we could only dream of aeons ago but are construct space that can be explored in ◦ (VR). Unlike traditional technologies, virtual reality (VR) plunges the user in a virtual world to give an interactive experience []. It has been revealed that virtual conspicuous characteristics of completely synthetic vistas. Commercial VR removes real-world vision and provides video to each eye, allowing for depth of view []. It is a virtual environment in which the user is fully immersed and is interacting with real items via interactive techniques via the Internet. This technology is augmented with head and body tracking to link the virtual environment to the user is viewing. Furthermore, VR is described as the “farthest end from reality in the Reality-Virtuality Horizon” []. In a VR environment, users can produce their own content, to devote their complete attention to the virtual worlds, which are distinct from the real environments []. Interacting with virtual entities in a virtual space can assist in discovering user accessibility, such as changing the scene’s shape and adding new tasks. The collaboration between multiple users in virtual space can therefore occur in real-time, which aligns with well-defined requirements for virtual environments, including a sense of location, time, and availability, gestures, texts, and voice communication, and information sharing []. Furthermore, Virtual Reality expands democratization and permits more humans to engage with digitization. For example, Google’s Tilt Brush5 enables customers to create unique artworks using VR goggles. The link between new and classic arts technologies is not unidirectional; harmoniously. When contemplating the Metaverse, users should locate themselves in their own shared spaces while interacting with the physical analogue, such as AR and the Metaverse is to create multiple shared spaces in which to undertake concurrent activities among existing objects, avatars, and their relationships, for FIGURE . Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), explored in depth. example, Object-to-object, object-to-avatar, and avatar-to- avatar interactions. To represent the events of the virtual spaces, all users who participate in the virtual environment must synchronize []. However, synchronizing dynamic events at scale is a large problem because unlimited users can simultaneously together act on virtual objects and interact with one other without reasonable latency, which might to users. VR in the Metaverse seems to be a more advancing technology that may be deployed for various purposes, such as classrooms, to help teach a subject or topic by allowing students to ‘experience’ the Digital visual elements, music, or other sensory stimuli are used in augmented reality (AR) to enhance the physical world. Commercial apps and mobile computing companies are embracing it. Augmented reality (AR) goes beyond virtual worlds to improve our physical surroundings through different experiences. Audio, images, taste, and touch are all possible perceptual input channels for computer-generated virtual elements [], [], []. Digital toppings are pro- jected on top of our physical environments using the first generation of AR system frameworks. Users’ participation with digital entities has been studied extensively in AR so ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE far. It is worth noting that digital entities are superimposed on top of the user’s physical surroundings, allowing users to perform many actions at once, similar to VR. Interactions with such digital entities in AR are difficult and intended to connect people between the physical world and the Metaverse []. The majority of science fiction films use urban and peri-urban concepts to present intuitive AR user interfaces []. Like, Voodoo Dolls offered a freehand technique in which the user can select and work with virtual content using squeeze motions. Later, HOMER proposed a method [] that provides ray-casting from the user’s virtual hand, displays item selections, and is finally deceived. Furthermore, AR will play an important part in our daily lives, such as gaming, annotating directions in new regions, and locating objects based on user surroundings []. As a result, we can anticipate that the AR in Metaverse will integrate urban environments, and digital entities will appear in visible and tangible ways on top of various physical things in metropolitan places. We can conclude that AR will facilitate communication between the physical and virtual worlds in the Metaverse. However, mapping virtual objects with regard to their corresponding position in the real environment needs a significant amount of effort for simple actions such as detection and tracking [], [], []. As the first research prototype of augmented reality outdoors, Traveling Machine is considered groundbreaking. A head- mounted display containing map navigation information and a GPS device are included in the prototype. Using a pointer and touch surface, users interact with AR maps []. A recent AR headset, however, has shown great advancements, particularly in mobility. AR headsets can receive video and auditory feedback, but other senses remain untapped, including smell and haptics []. Interestingly, AR headsets the only way to view Metaverse content. AR patches, as well as digital entities from the Metaverse, can be supplied via a variety of devices, limited to AR headsets [], [], hand-held tablet devices [], overhead projectors [], and tabletops [], Pico (portable) projectors [], and so on. Matter of fact, in terms of switching user attention and occupying users’ hands, AR headsets have an advantage over other tactics. this technique is that users must shift their focus between physical environments and digital material on other sorts of AR gadgets. AR headsets also allow users to visualize [], [], and the user’s hands will not be burdened by tangible items functioning as processing elements. These advantages make AR headsets more immersive in the Metaverse via AR lenses. Augmented reality continues to evolve and spread across a wide range A mixed reality (MR) environment is one in which physical and digital items coexist and interact in real time in a physical and virtual world. In other words, we can say that MR is a hybrid of AR and VR technologies [], and we will go over the role of MR in the Metaverse further. There is no formal definition of MR, but it is imperative to have a name that describes the alternate reality that exists between the two poles of AR and VR. While reading the previous literature, we came across several descriptions of MR, including a “traditional” notion of MR in Continuum [], MR as a generic term for AR [], MR as a type of liaison [], MR as a combo of AR and VR [], MR as a synchronisation of environments [], and a “greater” version of AR []. MR is a combination of AR and VR that allows users to interact with virtual elements in physical environments, according to the scientific community. Nowadays, mobile AR is the most popular mixed reality service on social media. Mix reality events are created by AR filters on Instagram. Microsoft Windows Mixed Reality combines all user experiences to create holographic portrayals of people, 3D models, and their real environment. In comparison, as seen in existing applications [], AR typically shows information layered on physical locations without regard for compatibility. Due to the massive aforementioned characteristics of MR, it is regarded a more powerful version of AR, with collective linkages to physical spatial, user interaction, and virtual entities [], [], [], []. Humans, computers, and the surroundings can interact naturally and immersively with mixed reality. The world of computer vision, graphics, display technologies, input methods, and cloud computing has changed dramatically. Sensor and processing power breakthroughs are resulting in novel computer perceptions of surroundings based on innovative input modalities. A person’s body position in the physical world, objects, surfaces, and boundaries, environmental lighting and sound, object classification, and geographical locations can all be captured via environmental inputs. To fully utilize the Metaverse, we must have smooth outdoor mobility enabled by cellular networks such as the 5G and 6G networks. With the advent of 6G technology, 5G has been ruled out, but it is still being rolled out to replace the aging 4G standard []. As shown in the Table  below, we have laid out different ways in which enabling technologies play a key role from 1G to 6G. 6G networks are being developed and are projected to be speedier, with increased capacity and fewer latency []. It can be seen that 6G networks will encompass a wide range of capabilities, as well as current mobile applications such as VR/AR, AI, and the IoT. Mobile network operators are also predicted to use flexible licensing, bandwidth allocation, and connectivity sharing. Mobile edge computing, short-packet communication, and blockchain technology would be responsible for all of this. As evidence suggests that new wireless technologies are released regularly after every ten years, it may be anticipated that  will be in use by . In the future, more designs and protocols will be launched in 6G. Users will continue to use more IoT, mobile devices, and similarly use a lot of TABLE .

Although 6G is replacing 5G [], however, 5G tech- required. Wireless telecommunication industries continue to rely on 4G for consumer use, and 5G is attempting to replace the outdated technology, albeit gradually, with most deployments taking place in tightly populated regions. In , the 4G/LTE [] standard was introduced, which proved to be a game-changer for mobile devices by increasing data speed and letting users watch HD movies, play online games, and exchange enormous amounts of data at speeds of up to  Mbps. 5G [] outperforms 4G by using microwave and mmWave technology to boost its speed to roughly  Mbps or more. Faster speeds and capacity are comparable to commercial broadband providers, offering more uses beyond streaming media. IoT and edge computing will have real-time sensing capabilities, which means they will obtain data instantaneously by leveraging the cloud. In the healthcare profession, such as medical services, instantaneous knowledge from patients is required for diagnosis and treatment, which can only be accomplished with faster computations; therefore, 5G has applications in ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE retail and industry. The list is virtually endless, but we will not see 5G’s entire potential until the advanced technology ) 6G AND INTERNET OF EVERYTHING As already mentioned, 6G [] is still in development and is too early to have accurate information on its technology or functionality. We anticipate that the telecommunications industry will use dynamic, decentralized marketing strategies with local spectrum licensing/sharing and infrastructure shar- ing in 5G. 6G is fully integrated with Internet-based systems that enable speedy communication between users, gadgets, automobiles and the surrounding environment []. As a result, it is possible to estimate when we will transition from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Internet of Everything (IoET), which 6G could theoretically deliver. The existing fibers can provide up to  Gbps; however, the researchers believe that a 6G network could provide thousands of times quicker than optical fibres. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has opened the door to 6G speeds in , enabling firms to experiment with terahertz waves in the -GHz to  THz spectrum. 5G, on the other hand, uses a low band as low as  GHz to  GHz, such as mmWave and microwave technology. Although terahertz waves could enhance 6G speeds to  Tbps, they would be subject to the same restrictions as 5G. Using N-Polar gallium nitride high- electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs), researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara have created a device to speed up the 6G development process. These HEMETs feature a junction between two materials with differing bandgaps that work as a channel instead of the common doped region found in MOSFETS, allowing the device to operate at significantly higher frequencies ( to  THz), as required by 6G []. As time passes, new advancements in 6G emerge. Last year, researchers from Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University and Japan’s Osaka University produced a device for terahertz waves that could be used for 6G []. Engineers designed millimeter wave products for G-bands that function in terahertz waves this year. A few tools can help 6G become a reality and progress beyond the research phase. It may take the time that 6G becomes increasingly widespread in real-time applications to roll out 5G progressively. E. AR/VR/MR DEPLOYMENTS ON 5G/6G NETWORKS Although AR/VR technology has existed for a couple of its scale adoption depends on 5G/6G technology and edge computing. In order to enable the use cases, 5G/6G must bring ultra-low latency and high bandwidth. As a result of private 5G/6G solutions, many industrial and enterprise customers can carry out mission-critical processes with the capabilities necessary to accomplish this. While public 5G/6G networks do not extend adequate coverage, do not deliver a particular ability to the required level, or are deemed to be unreliable, private 5G/6G networks provide the capabilities required for mission-critical applications. The metaverse proves to have huge potential when it comes to securing the AR/VR/MR space in the future. It is designed to allow its users to build a full-featured virtual world governed by a set of rules without the involvement of platform developers or the risk of being exposed to their risks. The second benefit of BC is that it allows copyright protection to be applied to the content as a user may record it. Finally, BC can enhance the popularity of VR by merging the market for cryptocurrencies with VR, resulting in increased profitability due to the merger. There are several aspects of AR/VR/MR that could benefit from the use of 6G that are • With the advent of 6G networks, communicate at THz in the submillimetre range with extremely low latency. As part of 6G, virtualized service sets simplify holographic communication over physical boundaries and enhance management capabilities. As a result, 3D imagery can be experienced in real-time (XR) in conjunction with autonomous driving, etc. • For data security in AR/VR applications, it is essential to ensure trusted decentralization among multiple nodes to ensure massive data-sharing. • The fast display and processing of images and videos required by AR/VR assets requires that the data be stored and exchanged through a local central server due to the amount of memory and processing required • Since AR/VR-oriented applications AR [], [], [] consume a great deal of data and bandwidth; the central server could become overloaded due to multiple asyn- chronous communications among the AR/VR devices. • For military and battlefield applications that use AR/VR devices, Blockchain improves cybersecurity through • By creating a user-defined marketplace for storing and uploading AR content, Metaverse can assist commercialization of AR devices. • In addition to assisting users and developers in down- loading and uploading content, communication can also facilitate the development of new applications and set up marketplaces and storefronts for AR/VR/MR devices to make them more commercially viable. AR/VR/MR [], [], [] into 5G/6G networks can be found in the Table . The adoption of AR and VR at scale has yet to become mainstream. 5G and edge computing can now overcome some of these challenges. We explore specific use cases and real-life applications in Section VII. In this section, we present the AI pyramid for Metaverse technology, followed by methods related to different learning paradigms, computer vision, and Edge AI. This subsec- tion also serves as a basis for discussing sustainable metaverse in Section VI. Post Facebook’s name change TABLE .

The labels on the right side are original layers deﬁned in “Building the Metaverse”, while the labels on the left side exhibit equivalent mapping in the context of AI. to Meta, the rejuvenation of the Metaverse field has been the talk of the research community. Another reason for towards the Metaverse is its impact on socioeconomic and technological aspects, such as combin- ing 3D animation, virtual reality, blockchain, non-fungible tokens, digital economy, and many others. The non-fungible tokens (NFTs) created a lot of hype that explained the role of blockchain in the context of the Metaverse, however, this section will mainly focus on the role of AI in the said technology. Recently, an article was surfaced, which explained the concept of the Metaverse in the context of value chain. The article summarized the Metaverse as the (real-time activity-based Internet) and proposed an abstract layered architecture for the same. We use the seven-layered Metaverse architecture as a reference to explain the role of AI, as shown in Figure . We briefly explain the areas and define the equivalent AI mapped role in the layered schema to understand the diversity and advancements that AI brings to the field of Metaverse. This correspondent has already . https://medium.com/building-the-Metaverse/the-Metaverse-and- artificial-intelligence-ai- ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE been performed by David Pereira, but this study further elaborates on the use of AI in each layer, accordingly. We explain each of the corresponding layers in a bottom-up AIInfra: It is apparent that with increasing popularity, a large number of users will opt to use the services associated with Metaverse. In this regard, the infrastructure should be capable of accommodating massive machine-type communi- cation (mMTC) devices along with the support for executing AI-based models. Furthermore, it should be noted that the infrastructure is the base for the services being offered at stacked layers, therefore, the support for temporary storage of data or support for cloud connectivity is also necessary. For instance, 5G/6G networks already allow support for AI devices and operations. Similarly, Microelectromechanical (MEMs) devices enable the wearables to perform automatic sensing and data collection, and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) enable the device to perform faster computations. Currently, there are many plug-n-play solutions available for making backward devices compatible with the newer ones. Application program interfaces (APIs) and software packages allow passive hardware to work as active ones. For some applications, it is the software only that is needed to obtain the desired results. Therefore, AI-devices AI-based devices refer to both hardware and software, respectively. Together, the AI-based devices provides the necessary infrastructure to perform decision-level operations and allow the Metaverse services to operate in a seamless manner, hence the name, AI-based Infrastructure (AIInfra). AIInt: Metaverse services heavily rely on user experiences to make them satisfactory, design of user interface is the initial step. Although the design of interactive and intuitive user interfaces helps improve social interactions, it can be a hindrance to some of the users that include disabled, introvert, and specially challenged people. To make the interface accessible in general, AI methods can be extensively used (AIInt). For instance, usage of computer vision approaches for visually challenged users, or generating automated voice from text for visually impaired ones, design of social avatars for friendly interaction in virtual world, brain computer interface for specially challenged users, and so forth. AI-based methods can not only be used for enabling the user-experience in terms of interface design for some users, but also can be used to improve the accessibility and interaction with the interfaces, in general. As the users interact with the devices in AIInfra through the interface, AIInt becomes their main impression. Users, especially in Metaverse, would not like to be frustrated with badly or complex designed interfaces. As the applications in Metaverse will increase, they will strive for the users’ time and AIInt would be one of the reasons for either churning in or out of the application. A recent survey from Localytics10 . https://towardsdatascience.com/how-ai-will-shape-the-Metaverse- . http://info.localytics.com/blog/mobile-apps-whats-a-good-retention- indicates that % of the users churn out before  months if the interface is not user friendly and upto their expectations. AICont: Decentralization has been extensively achieved through smart contracts and blockchain based methods, however, Metaverse emphasizes on democratization along with the decentralization. Decentralization allows users and creators to protect ownership and exchange entitlements and assets easily in the digital space; however, not ensure disintermediation from corporations, financial institutions, and investors. For instance, let us consider the Adidas NFT case, which was dropped in December  with a constraint that purchases were limited to  persons. The NFT was sold out in less than  second because a single user purchased  of them in a single transaction. This was accomplished by modifying smart contracts, which the democratization cannot be achieved by just using conventional contracts. Democratization refers to the equal opportunity for all users, the power from big corporations. In this regard, AI can be used to detect modifications and anomalies concerning smart contracts, hence the name AI-based smart contracts (AICont). Furthermore, AICont can leverage the information acquired from AIInt and infrastructure to detect non- democratic activities for preventing such kind of incidents AIVWorld: The creation of virtual environments is of importance in Metaverse, and making it believably realistic is one of the research challenges to solve. Some examples of digital worlds are NVIDIA’s Omniverse11 and Spatial IO. These platforms provide a set of components to simulate the real-world objects and create unique digital worlds in quite an impressive manner. The use of AI is extensive in creating this set of components as the process needs to be autonomous, realistic, and visually pleasing (AIVWorld). These virtual worlds can be used for variety of applications such as building massive worlds, creating simulation environments for robots and autonomous vehicles, simulating voice-based commands in the digital world, and so forth. AI will be responsible for not only creating realistic digital worlds, but also testing automation within the Metaverse. Some snapshots from Spatial IO virtual environment are shown in Figure . AIART-E: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have proven to be a stepping stone in Metaverse from an economic perspective. It is the empowerment of artists and non-artists alike. The artists might use the platform to broaden their horizon and appeal while the non-artists may use it to learn new skills or adding diversity to their portfolio. For non-artists, AI can be used to generate unique art as well. Considering the expansion of AI usage among noncoders (thanks to GPT- and similar models), the users will be able to generate their own NFTs. The advances in natural language processing . https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-omniverse-platform FIGURE . AI in Avatar and Environment Design for Metaverse: Image courtesy: https://spatial.io/. enrichment (AIART-E) in the digital space. Unique stories can be generated using models such as GPT- [], [], while realistic unique art can be generated from a single line of text using DALL-E [], [] and GauGAN2 []. There are also community-driven platforms governed by autonomous artists that build algorithms to create arts. One of such community-driven platforms is Botto. Some creations from Botto, GauGAN2, and DALL-E are shown in Figure . [], [] The use of AIART-E provides an economic sustainability by creating circular economy SocialAI: The core motivation behind Metaverse is to create an interactive environment that improves the social network experience. However, with current social networking platforms, there is a lot of abuse, hate, and serious concerns in terms of safety and inclusion for children and minorities. Such constraints can contribute to the depowering of digital personalization and self-knowledge, which are the things that Metaverse stands for. The use of artificial intelligence can be leveraged to improve the experience of social networks (social AI). The techniques can be used for the machine learning observability, focus more on Explainable AI that can avoid bias, compute content relevance with respect to the minority groups belonging to different ethnicity, culture, geography and language, and detect hate and abusive ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE FIGURE . Images generated with Botto, GauGAN2 and DALL-E. PersonalizedAI: The final layer in Metaverse pyramid is the hyper-personalization in terms of experience. In terms the former layers leverage the techniques to achieve goals that ultimately contribute to enhance the user’s performance. However, the experience enhancement was applied in a general manner. In this layer, the goal is to provide the user with a personalized experience that is specific to each user in the Metaverse. For instance, adjust the gaming models with respect to users’ emotions or mental well-being, or apply personalization by considering the users’ disabilities. Personalized AI can be explored in different ways for a variety of applications such as education, healthcare, gaming, socialization, sports, and others using semantics to make leaps of progress in digital reality. While Meta is exploring the self-supervised paradigm, Google’s DeepMind has stuck with supervised learning and uses massive amounts of data from VRChat digital agent on how to interact with humans in a simplified environment. In  alone,  million hours of VR data was generated. Google DeepMind used , hours of VRChat data to train a digital agent to learn ground language while interacting with humans. The study showed that the digital agent becomes curious and autonomous with such a training strategy. According to the experiments, the DeepMind suggested that it could pave the way for understanding how the Metaverse could be equipped with A. LEARNING PARADIGMS FOR METAVERSE Over the years, applications in Metaverse such as robotics, reality, augmented reality, digital rendering, and more saw remarkable progress through super- vised learning techniques []. However, the supervised learning strategy tends to make the Metaverse application task dependent, as it is highly based on human supervision. Although, diversified learning strategies such as reinforce- ment learning [], self-supervised learning [], and more have been proposed to make the Metaverse application task its still a work in progress. The Meta AI research group is exploring the self-supervised paradigm, specifically in the domain of text and speech, advances in task-independent learning networks. Recently, Meta AI research released the data2vec model which is presented as a unified solution for the speech, vision, and natural language processing task while leveraging multiple modalities []. Currently, Meta AI is working towards more unified models that could leverage multiple modalities while helping in reading lips and understanding the speech B. COMPUTER VISION FOR METAVERSE In the field of computer vision, Metaverse has gained the most progress, as researchers can replicate human-like avatars or hologoraphic images of loved ones in the digital world. William Shatner who played Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise in vintage star trek television series is one of the most beloved actors. An AI startup StoryFile17 acquired hours of William Shatner’s footage while answering questions using volumetric cameras. The footage was acquired with a green screen so that William Shatner’s image can be easily segmented, and a proprietary model Conversa was used to associate answers with the asked the startup built a lifelike videobot of the aforementioned actor. Although, green screen, there are many deep learning based semantic segmentation methods that does not need a green screen to get a person segmented in even a complex scene, such . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-fvsi9YIP4 as FCN [], UPerNet [], BiSeNet [], FPN [], SFNet [], SegFormer [], FaPN [], CondNet [], There are further many projects in development that can be considered as a technological leap towards Metaverse. For instance, companies are working on the hologram of is an innovative medium to keep stories from the past alive using artificial A socially distant santaclaus19 and avatars of the loved ones. Recently, Microsoft [] registered a patent for an AI system that could help an individual dead loved one through its 3D digital version. Similarly, Replika AI20 is also trying to address mental well-being and loneliness through a digital avatar. Apart from people, researchers are also trying to build a digital system for animals. Researchers from Ubisoft china have proposed a rendering keyframe animation method, i.e., ZooBuilder [] for animals by using OpenPose method [] for extracting 2D joint coordinates and 2D-3D human pose estimator [] to track the temporal relationships between connected joints. With the emergence of Metaverse, many Internet-based tools now use computer vision techniques to provide animated 3D human models or realistic animated faces, some of them include Kinetix,,Mixamo22 and StyleGAN2 []. One of the developments that is specific to the integra- tion of computer vision and Metaverse is the design and development of 3D spaces and virtual worlds. 3D spaces in Metaverse refers to the rendering and modeling process to create virtual environment. The 3D spaces where users can interact with virtual objects and each other in a 3D environ- ment both in statis and immersive manner. The developers and designers used the tools to not only create environments but provide a way to sustain the Metaverse. These tools include but not limited to Decentraland, Open Metaverse Interoperability Group (OMIG), Blender, WebXR Device API, Webaverse, XREngine, JanusWeb, and HyperCube. The 3D spaces have variety of applications that include social interaction, training, education, and gaming. An example of the 3D spaces and virtual worlds is shown in Figure . Seamingly, researchers are also trying to figure out an optimized way of creating 3D spaces in the Metaverse. For instance, Lo and Tsai [] proposed the use of a virtual reality architecture (VRAM) to enhance the human cognition using cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Their experimental study revealed that the learning process using VRAM is significantly faster in comparison to existing studies. Gao and Yang [] took a different approach by using collision detection algorithm and the interpenetration of the objects and human body in the virtual word to . https://www.cbsnews.com/news/artificial-intelligence-holocaust- remembrance--minutes---/ . https://edition.cnn.com////health/children-social-distance- optimize the placement of buildings and their interaction. The authors suggested that the realism of their proposed work is superior than the existing methods. Zhao et al. [] proposed a framework that highlights the visual elements for not only fuel the visual exploration and construction in the Metaverse but also improve its realism from user perspective. They proposed methods and techniques in three phases to improve the graphics content and visual construction pipeline in the Metaverse. The method also provides details on physics-based animation and geometric modeling to design and development 3D spaces. Wang et al. [] also proposed the framework for creating 3D spaces in Metaverse using macro perspective and human computer interaction theories to improve the user experience. The technical framework and its performance was compared in this study with their existing counterparts to evaluate the efficacy of user experience in the Metaverse. As the Metaverse is currently being implemented by tech giants and is in process of integrating with daily human lives, more sophisticated methods, tools, and frameworks are being developed to improve the 3D spaces in Metaverse as well as improving the user experiences for interacting with the elements designed in 3D spaces, accordingly. C. OBJECT GENERATION IN METAVERSE Although Metaverse is a broad concept but to many, its socializing and performing activities within the digital space. Imagine if that digital space is an empty space, who would like to interact and socialize in it? The concept of object generation is quite crucial to the environments in Metaverse as it creates basis for the users to interact and hang out in that digital space. Metaverse needs 3D objects and assets both in terms of diversity and quantity. For instance, for a particular meeting, contemplation, gaming or work, the Metaverse requires wide variety of environments, buildings, and objects to be created. Furthermore, the design of the aforementioned entities also require customization to be different and enhance the immersive experience. However, creating such 3D assets and objects are time-consuming and costly for the developers, 3D designers, and artists. In addition, they have to put a lot of efforts to add variations in terms of textures and geometry for perceiving it to be of high- quality. It will be a continuous process for the Metaverse as it is a content-hungry platform, therefore, the developers, 3D designers, and artists will have to exhaust themselves or an army like workforce will be needed for the generation of Generative AI technologies can help in not only solving the aforementioned issue but also accompany the artists and 3D designers to boost their productivity. Over the years, researchers have progressed in developing generative models that could leverage the existing data distribution including faces, objects, and text. Generative models can also be termed as distribution transformers as they leverage the prior distribution to sample and transform the modality to ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE target distribution. A sample workflow for generating faces • Use multivariate normal distribution to sample random • Train the discriminator network to recognize real and • Train the generator network to transform prior nor- mal distribution to image distribution representing 2D to discriminator for verifying whether the generator network generates real or fake faces. • If discriminator network identifies the input as fake, repeat the training step until the input is identified as In order for the above steps to work properly, it requires a lot of data from the target distribution, computing platform (GPUs) to train, and a lot of training time, respectively. Even though, there are some constraints but the diffusion and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown to be exceptional in generating data. Recently, StyleGAN [] was proposed for image to image translation applications. A recent study has leveraged the StyleGAN to generate high fidelity human faces without acquiring additional facial data []. It is also one of the examples where transfer learning can help in leveraging existing pre-trained network to be used for personalized applications. The objects and virtual entities can now also be generated through text description, thanks to recent Dall-E_2 [] and Google’s Imagen []. It is astonishing and quite helpful for Metaverse environment as it uses natural language to generate the images, which is a natural way of interacting among humans and describing any object. Furthermore, it can also help in creating diversifying and personalized content specific to each user while the user interacts with The above-mentioned methods can create 2D images Metaverse as the user will interact with the objects and will perceive them in 3D environments. Therefore, the object generation needs to be performed in 3D as well. In this regard, a recent breakthrough has been achieved by NVIDIA with their instance neural radiance fields (Instant NERF) method [] that undertakes some 2D images from different camera angles and generates a 3D scene. Once generated, the rendering of object in 3D can be performed instantly with respect to the camera motion and viewing. With such progression in generative networks, the content creators and 3D designers will be able to create 3D objects quite easily in the Metaverse, especially for virtual universes or games where the environment requires a certain level of realism. The use of Edge AI would be quite crucial for realizing Metaverse, as it is highly dependent on low latency and high throughput to meet the needs of user experience. The fifth generation (5G) networks meet  Gbps and delay of less than  milliseconds, but as per the estimations and forecasts, the delay needs to be lower and the peak data rate needs to be higher order to sustain user experiences in Metaverse. Thanks to the use of AI techniques in combination with edge the foundation to develop emerging mission- critical applications is laid []. Several deep learning, soft computing, and machine learning techniques have been proposed to achieve uRLLC, be it active user detection [], resource allocation [], scheduling problems [], and power-management problems [], accordingly. Recently, AI has also been exploited for mobility prediction, traffic estimation, channel prediction, and spectrum management for maintaining uRLLC. For instance, SCGNet [] and MCNet [] were introduced to enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency while demodulating the receiver’s signal accurately. In [] a combination of CNN and LSTM for improving robustness in practical 5G systems. The study [] proposed a 3D convolutional networks for forecasting cellular traffic by leverage long and short term spatial patterns from the traffic data. In summary, Edge AI techniques are very crucial in achieving low latency with high throughput that acts like a support system for high class integrated services in Metaverse. E. 6G: A REQUIREMENT FOR AI-BASED METAVERSE The services associated with Metaverse rendered by AI require the infrastructure to be scalable, services to be lightning fast which require low latency, reliability through stable connection, and security. Although the current gener- ation of communication system, i.e., LTE and 5G, provide some of the basis to realize Metaverse its still far away from large-scale implementation due to the aforementioned characteristics. Since the metaverse needs to support atleast thousands if not millions of remote devices that need to process and transmit huge amounts of data, will be the core issue for current network environment as it is considered to be the bottleneck for adaptation of wide array of applications []. Some haptic and spatial AI applications require latency of less than 1ms while the transfer rate of more than  Mbps []. The fifth generation communication system alleviate this problem to some extent but as the Metaverse grows, which is assumed to be the case, a stable and faster new generation of mobile communication will be definitely required []. As discussed in previous subsections, models will play a key role in understanding user preferences and generating customized and unique environments. In this regard, the training of such models require computing power and a stable connection []. However, researchers have shown that the current iteration of network environment is not suitable for training large language models, rather it TABLE . Delays and bandwidth requirement for each of the layer in Metaverse pyramid. works better with small-scale ones, and one of the reasons for such failure is the lack of stable connection []. Therefore, in order to realize the metaverse with its full potential, the communication network needs to play an effective part along with the AI methods, respectively. We analyzed several studies [], [], [], [], requirement gathering concerning delays and bandwidth with respect to each layer in Metaverse pyramid shown in  and report the figures in . The requirement is gathered with respect to delay, average inference time (AIT), average inference time with enhanced user experience (AIT-EUE), transmission bit rate (TBR), and transmission bit rate with compression (TBR-C), respectively. The AIT- EUE refers to the data enhancement techniques for enhancing user experience, for instance, image denoising, image super resolution, and more. The AIT-EUE mainly depends upon the image resolution (assuming that Metaverse mainly deals with imaging technologies). The relationship with the inference time is simple, higher the resolution, higher the inference time. The reported values are in terms of average and also hypothetical, as Metaverse and 6G are not realized to a larger extent. For AICONT, we considered the average transaction speed of cryptocurrencies that are fastest, such as Algorand and EOS. The values for average transaction speed for the cryptocurrencies and related information are obtained using Statista23 and Algorand Blog, while the information regarding NFTs are obtained using Chainalysis. The requirement suggests that the current iteration of commu- nication system (5G) will not be able to meet most of the requirements, thus, the realization of Metaverse is closely tied with the emergence of sixth generation communication system which promises to have lesser delays, latency, and higher transmission bit rates, accordingly. IV. ROLE OF B5G/6G IN METAVERSE This section outlines the importance of B5G/6G services towards Metaverse in Sections IV-A and IV-B, followed by a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art wireless communication technologies for immersive experiences in . https://www.statista.com/statistics//cryptocurrency- . https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/role-of-transaction-finality- . https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/chainalysis-web3-report-preview- It is anticipated that Metaverse will be grounded on large- scale wireless cellular network technologies for the purpose of telecomputing, telecommuting, teleporting, teleoperating, telepresence, avatar interactions, and data mobility. The interactive and immersive experiences inside Metaverse will require very high data rates and low latency while trans- mitting high-resolution content. 5G networks could deliver data rates of up to <10GBs by exploiting the mmWave (- GHz) spectrum []. This frequency and data rate remained successful in fulfilling the uplink and downlink throughput requirements of several multimedia applications ranging from live streaming to connected and autonomous vehicles. However, Metaverse is likely to interconnect a wide range of such services potentially involving holographic communication and real-time haptics, requiring milliseconds of motion-to-photon latency. Consequently, the bandwidth and throughput requirements for delivering such services will be 103x more compared to the existing 5G-based cellular systems []. Therefore, 5G and pre-5G networks will not support the Metaverse for the following key reasons: ) Proliferation of devices: Metaverse is expected to drive the growth of mobile and other IoT devices significantly. Thus, the connection density of 5G and pre-5G networks will not be able to accommodate the ) Multi-sensory communications: Apparently, Metaverse will bring immersive services with multisensory com- munications that will pose stringent challenges to existing 5G QoS and QoE classes. Thus, 5G and pre- 5G wireless systems will fail to provide a seamless experience to multiple immersive services such as avatar interactions or teleoperations in parallel. ) Complex and ultra-massive connectivity: Metaverse is envisioned to build on prolific heterogeneous devices distributed in a highly dynamic, complex and ultra- massive network. In such a scenario, the existing 5G and pre-5G services catalog will not offer a reliable solution since those services are often designed for static and predefined optimization challenges. ) Decentralized services: Decentralized intelligence will be a cornerstone in Metaverse driven heterogeneous multi-machine, multi-technology, multi-user, multi- application, and multi-device environments. Although 5G architecture can support the AI services on the ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE required by Metaverse is beyond the original goals of current 5G networks. The transmission rate offered by 5G can not guarantee the resilient edge AI because AI models will need to be subtle and highly dynamic while serving on the edge or other devices Pre-5G networks successfully supported the deployment of AR among retail applications, educational services, the gaming arena, and Google Maps []. VR/AR devices such as Google Glass, Toshiba dynaEdge, Microsoft hololens , etc., and mobile applications such as IKEA Place, Pokemon Go, etc., have widely benefited from pre-5G networks. These apps and devices were not only self- sufficient but also leveraged Internet access via pre-5G access methods. Studies show that VR/AR users gained adequate experience via 4G LTE networks []. However, such networks are insufficient to meet Metaverse users’ expec- tations. Metaverse will bring in next-generation multimedia such as real-time haptic feedback, high dynamic range (HDR), and stereoscopic video formats. The estimated data rate required to render a stereoscopic HDR ◦ video of 8K resolution with  frames per second (FPS) is 200Mbps []. In addition, the holographic avatars will be rendered as a physical presence for remote users in Metaverse. The rendering of holographic avatars will be witnessed in situations where a doctor will be required to perform remote surgery, an engineer to troubleshoot in a remote factory, and a farmer to look after the grass and animals in remote geographic locations. Apart from typical graphical properties (e.g., resolution, depth, texture, or color), the holographs will be organized from various postures to ensure consistency in angles, frames, and slopes relative to the avatar. If an avatar is rendered in tiles of ” x ” dimensions, then an avatar with a ’ x ” human size will require a transmission rate of . Tb/s []. According to a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) analysis on the communication aspect of healthcare services, a remote AR-based surgery can operate on approximately <1ms of E2E latency and  Gbps of transmission rate considering an HDR 10bits stream of 4K resolution with 120fps []. Metaverse is envisioned to deal with longer durations of remote surgeries, operations, and other clinical To offer immersive experiences in Metaverse, additional synchronization will be required apart from high data rates to ensure seamless transmission of multisensory content delivery and user experience. Such requirements are beyond the offerings of pre-B5G/6G systems, and non-3GPP access networks, including Wi-Fi, will be impractical due to the performance benchmarks and handover from mobility []. Thereby, B5G/6G plays its role in . https://www.google.com/glass/start/ . https://us.dynabook.com/smartglasses/products/index.html . https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/ . https://www.ikea.com/au/en/customer-service/mobile-apps/say-hej- . https://pokemongolive.com/en/ recognizing the demands mentioned above. In the subsequent section, we will entail the enabling technologies offered by B. WHAT B5G/6G BRINGS TO METAVERSE? Since Metaverse is coined to be the next sory network services such as haptic and holographic communications. Soon users will undermine the QoE delivered by VR/AR and demand new lifelike multimedia experiences, unlike today’s not−real−enough VR/AR expe- riences. Metaverse applications involving avatar interactions Internet traffic by  []. Thereby, the services provided by B5G/6G have a crucial role in realizing the lifelike (H2A) will drive the majority of ) 5G SERVICES TOWARDS METAVERSE 5G networks offer three prime categories of services listed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU): uRLLC, mMTC, and eMBB to handle the requirements of extremely low latency, enormous content transmission and high computations. eMBB traffic requires a gigabit/s level of the transmission rate. At the same time, uRLLC expects high reliability of .% with ultra-low-latency of . ∼ . ms/packet, and mMTC requires highly dense connectivity with significant energy efficiency. However, uRLLC can only provide a data rate of up to  Mbps which might fit in a few applications of VR/AR. In contrast, eMBB can be suitable for delivering ultra-high throughput the requirements of Metaverse users accessing multisensory content ranging from teleoperations to holoconferences to telesurgeries with 3D 4K resolutions. In addition, it can offer the minimum guaranteed delivery of  Mbps to users. Therefore, eMBB can play a crucial role in Metaverse’s gaming and entertainment paradigm by providing mobile users with - Mbps downlink with a peak threshold of  Mbps and latency of <100ms []. An evolution of VR technologies can be seen in Figure . From basic VR video streaming to interconnected VR to a fully wireless interconnected VR, a series of stages can be seen []. However, unlike conventional video streaming, wireless streaming in Metaverse may require transmitting enormous omnidirectional visual content with a latency of <20ms. The success of such an immersive virtual experience is highly reliable on a smooth transmission mechanism of ultra-high-resolution visual content along with a highly subtle tactile feedback in downlink networks. As discussed in Section IV-A, it is obvious to rely on the B5G wireless technologies to support the immersive virtual applications. Therefore, mmWave has progressed towards standardization FIGURE . Evaluation of VR experiences: a) VR over wired connectivity, b) VR over interconnected network, and c) VR over fully wireless connectivity []. by 3GPP in B5G wireless systems []. Simultaneously, researchers have also explored the potential of mmWave mobile networks in realizing the wireless bandwidth require- ments of VR applications. According to [], mmWave is able to successfully deliver high data rates with low- latency transmission for several VR applications. Similarly, the mMTC service can support dense mobile connectivity of up to  million devices per square kilometer which is approximately 10x greater than 4G LTE networks. A study by the European 5G Observatory33 reported the data obtained from  trials to assess the capacity of 5G in a dense urban area of Finland. The mMTC service was able to deliver a realistic data rate of  Mbps to  Gbps by accommodating a reasonable user density. Based on the overall analysis, 5G service equipped users’ devices with average data rates of -. Gbps with a delay of <5ms []. Since a few Metaverse applications will require a data rate ranging from  Mbps to a few Gbps with % reliability and a delay of <5ms, 5G networks may fulfill requirements efficiently. Apart from that, Metaverse users will utilize the diverse features of mobile systems ranging from display and sensing capabilities to near-user computing resources []. In addition, the recent innovations in vision and tracking technologies such as depth, ◦ resolution and precision have supported the idea of user’s interactions with the surroundings. These capabilities are not limited to smartphones; many devices such as fitness watches, smart TVs, game consoles, and autonomous vehicles also possess these features. These devices can leverage the services of 5G with single-digit latency, high throughputs (i.e., 10x > 4G), five-nines of network reliability and dense network coverage (i.e.,> -100x) []. In , 5G smartphones entered the . http://5gobservatory.eu/5g-trial/major-european-5g-trials-and-pilots/ commercialization phase and were expected to spread in the global market within the next few years []. The growth of these devices with seamless connectivity will certainly form the basis of several immersive services such as tele- classrooms, tele-surgeries, and teleoperations. Nevertheless, to deliver such services with a sufficient QoE requires very high data rates within a range of  Gb/s to  Tb/s which can be supported by B5G cellular and underlying transmission ) 6G SERVICES TOWARDS METAVERSE 6G networks are envisaged to provide ubiquitous intelligence with abundant compute power and high-speed wireless data fidelity over the air, space, and sea as shown in Figure . 6G services have been defined in terms of the real-time mesh of physical and cyber worlds, with a fine-grained focus on the interactions among physical, digital, and biological (human-centered) worlds [], []. An immersive merger of cyber and physical space is likely to bring new platforms in the shape of embodied Internet, providing 6G based Metaverse applications and other cyber-physical systems (CPS). 6G will exquisitely enhance user experience in the Metaverse since its services are primarily human-centric instead of data-centric. Consequently, Metaverse users and the associated processes, user equipment, and the network will be holistically integrated to provide a plethora of Moreover, 6G networks will empower edge intelligence through on-device machine/deep learning and distributed transform the “connectedness with intelli- gence” for not only human-centric but also machine-centric applications []. In Metaverse, 6G will enable neural and haptic sensory communications with an integrated holographic reinforcement []. 6G will also fulfill ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE Internet-of-Everything by featuring the network-in-box management and virtualized services that will motivate the massive multiple access points to shape a distributed (cell-less) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system []. In contrast supports terahertz frequency bands and is liable to provide  Tbps of data rate with an E2E delay of .1ms []. It also supports extremely reliable low latency commu- nications (eRLLC)-based services along with a reliability rate of .%. In principle, Metaverse users can achieve high QoE by leveraging the following 6G services: support for multi-dimensional holograms, ultra-massive data- transmission rates to support HDR ◦ multimedia with 4K/8K resolution, extreme low-latency and high precision for haptics required in 3D-printing, telepresence, immersive multi-user gaming, and responsive digital twins in industry .. Furthermore, these 6G services will be underpinned by AI, such as federated learning, split computing, and distributed deep reinforcement learning to reduce network congestion and improve the user QoE []. In summary, 6G will surpass the previous generations by catalyzing the wireless revolution from “connectivity” to “connectivity with intelligence” with the following key emerging services and utilities: • High data rates: The usage scenarios under ultra mobile broadband (uMBB) will exploit significantly higher data rates as compared to the ones in 5G eMBB services. • Dense connectivity: The ultra-massive machine-type communication (uMTC) scenario will empower use cases where a relatively higher and massive number of connections in a certain space will be required simultaneously as compared to the ones provided in • High reliability and precision: The services under ultra-high precision communication (uHPC) require a very high degree of precision, reliability and accurate positioning, making them suitable for mission-critical applications as opposed to 5G-URLLC services. These services ensure stringent service level guarantees can be enforced independently or in part with each other. • Air-to-ground connectivity: The services under extended -dimensional coverage (e3DC) will be able to exploit the in-space non-terrestrial satellite communications by utilizing the ground-based terrestrial mobile networks. The realm of in-space networks includes drones, high- altitude platform stations, and air-borne to provide multi-dimensional coverage across the globe. • Communication meets computation: The proliferation of emerging smart devices will urge the need for an autonomous and distributed computing framework to facilitate key technologies such as split computing and federated learning []. 6G will facilitate the computation-centric communication that will ensure the required QoS provisioning by trading off communication resources in order to achieve sufficient • Context-driven communications: The 6G network con- text, such as network architecture and bandwidth, will navigate the provisioning of 6G uMBB services to the users. It will significantly benefit the Metaverse applications since the physical context, such as the user’s location, mobility and social connections, will be highly dynamic, eventually leveraging the agile and adaptive service provisioning of 6G networks. • Event-driven communications: 6G networks will ensure the orderly provisioning of uHPC services based on certain characteristics of emergency or disaster events. The highly dynamic spatio-temporal attributes of users and devices, network traffic and infrastructure will play a key role in resource allocation in 6G-uHPC application Apart from the above services and their usage scenarios, 6G can also offer a hybrid of these services to meet the extreme demand for new performance metrics in the Metaverse that are unlikely to be achieved by 5G and pre- 5G networks. For instance, an application can leverage the combination of uMBB and uHPC, subject to the fulfillment of requirements of both services simultaneously. Similarly, uMTC and uHPC can be combined for a certain application if the needs of both services can be met simultaneously []. C. IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES OVER WIRELESS Immersive experiences are facilitated through virtual worlds, where the users experience a fully immersive environment, thus creating a meta-world that projects the real-world scenarios. State-of-the-art VR applications are embedded with a dynamic streaming framework that automatically adapts the bitrate of the XR content according to the network bandwidth and user’s geolocation []. Although the 5G legacy has remained capable of providing rudimentary XR support, scaling the adoption of XR devices and applications over wireless networks requires new research and engineering directions. Recently, 5G and beyond has paced further in boosting the XR performance by introducing various heterogeneous improvements in not only XR-specific entities but also service-related advancements. In contrast, a recent study by Meng et al. [] developed a prototype to enhance the immersive experience in metaverse by minimizing communication load while ensuring accurate synchronization between the physical world and its digital models. Table  shows several studies that investigated the role of state-of-the-art B5G/6G technologies for immersive mmWave for Wireless VR: Towards this end, the 3GPP is involved in standardization activities for mmWave com- munications in B5G/6G systems []. In the meantime, academia is also exploring the potential of mmWave mobile networks to support wireless VR streaming over high band- width []. The use of mmWave communications enables high transmission rates and low delay transmissions so that wireless VR applications can be seamlessly supported. the abundance of wireless bandwidth can further alleviate the scarcity of transmission rates through mmWave communications. Researchers generally consider  GHz mmWave wireless technologies since it only standardized mmWave wireless technology that has been identified so far based on the IEEE .11ad []. For example, authors in [] explore the potential of a 60GHz wireless channel to simultaneously process the large-scale multimedia content delivery in distributed VR MEC for Wireless VR: Another challenge in supporting VR experiences is that the videos must also remap pixels from a viewing sphere to a 2D viewport in order to distinguish their content form from traditional videos. The rendering process involves complex matrix mult-add operations and is extremely computationally intensive. Hence, the power consumption of virtual reality videos is significantly higher than other forms of video []. As a result, this will bring great challenges to the ubiquitous applications of wireless VR, as the continuous rendering of viewports will to exhaustion of battery and will eventually shorten the battery life. To address this challenge, various scenarios of MEC and caching have emerged as promising solutions to support wireless VR []. The deployment of MEC enable some computation tasks to be handled by in-network computing capacity. Additionally, some popular VR content and computational outputs can be cached to reduce the amount of repetitive computation and transmission. For example, in the article [], the theoretical architecture of a hybrid mobile computing system is presented concurrently that combines the processing abilities of cloud servers, MEC servers and end devices along with the caching capabilities of MEC servers. Similarly, according to [], VR tasks can be divided into several sub-components, and part of the sub- component can be cached using the mobile device’s caching mmWave meets MEC for Transmission Efficiency in Wireless VR: Furthermore, several studies have indicated that introducing FOV into ◦ video will reduce up to % of the bandwidth requirements compared to delivering ◦ video, hence lowering the overall necessary transmission data rate [], []. For example, authors in [] analyze the tradeoff between homogeneous and heterogeneous FOVs for a MEC-based mobile VR delivery model regarding compu- tations and caching tasks. In addition, several methods have been proposed that take advantage of the FOV of users, for instance, introducing FOV prediction [] and segregating different types of VR frames and multicasting them []. Based on the above discussion, it is apparent that more schemes can be developed if mmWave communication is combined with MEC-based FOV mechanisms. For instance, Liu et al. use mmWave and sub-6GHz link to transmit a panoramic virtual reality video (PVRV) stream by encoding the viewport and rendering the standby tiles according to different quality levels [], as shown in Figure . Similarly, Gputa et al. present A multiple-layer streaming FIGURE . Transmission of a panoramic virtual reality video (PVRV) stream using mmWave and sub-6GHz link on a MEC framework []. scheme in which the base layer is encoded and transmitted via Wi-Fi []. In contrast, a number of enhancement layers are transmitted via the mmWave access point. Therefore, a fusion of mmWave and MEC-based FOV schemes can reduce bandwidth requirements while reducing the transmission delay when compared with ◦ videos. Immersive fidelity with THz communication: Metaverse will use ◦ videos and MAR applications to bring immer- siveness, as well as AI-driven applications with ubiquitous integration. Due to this, vast amounts of data will be exchanged; hence the demand for radio frequency bandwidth spectrum will surge rapidly. The existing mmWave technol- ogy cannot satisfy this demand. Consequently, switching to the terahertz and sub-terahertz bands would be imperative. THz communications are able to deliver ultra-high through- put and low latency by supporting data-intensive applications such as VR/XR over wireless personal area networks []. Several studies have leveraged the unique benefits of THz to be implemented with 6G for immersive experiences. In a study by Du et al., authors examined the problem of providing a high-quality immersive VR video service []. In particular, the authors exploit the THz channel with MEC integration to optimize the immersive VR rendering, power management, and offloading viewports while satisfying the QoE constraints. Similarly, Chen et al. [] investigated an immersive application involving VR users transmitting images to a backend server. They formulated a problem to maximize the users’ successful probability by optimizing the downlink image transmission and the rotation of the surrounding images. Their proposed optimization problem involves a transfer learning approach consisting of liquid state machines to enhance the con- vergence speed by transferring the learned transmission into a new one. Despite the promising QoS delivery by propagation losses and water-molecule absorption losses due to high transmission frequency []. For this reason, THz has remained effective for indoor service delivery. For ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE TABLE . Summarising the role of state-of-the-art B5G/6G technologies in the context of Metaverse. instance, Liu et al. propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to efficiently maintain the long-term QoE in THz-based immersive systems []. Specifically, authors have studied a joint use of THz and RIS to create a VR network in an indoor scenario with an aim to enhance downlink transmission. To achieve the aim, the authors utilize the current and historical viewpoints of VR users obtained from real VR datasets to train a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model for predicting the dynamic viewpoint preference of VR users. Table  shows several studies that investigated the THz channels for immersive D. HOLOGRAPHIC TELEPRESENCE IN METAVERSE Metaverse users would be able to see high-quality, three-dimensional digital representations of people using Holograms and without wearing HMD. Future networks (i.e., B5G/6G) will be able to support extremely low latencies and ultra-high data rates with high reliability in order to underpin the holographic communication that will facilitate Metaverse users to fully immerse in gadget- free communication []. For example, a 6G network with .1ms of latency supported by an ultra-high bandwidth of Tbps can be leveraged for HT []. In order to evaluate there should be seamless and quality connections between users, which requires an extremely low-latency data transmission rate and massive low latency. A number of factors affect the required data rates, such as the method used to construct a hologram, of display and the number of images that need to be synchronized. For example, a typical hologram based on the point cloud techniques requires .– Gb/s, whereas a large-sized hologram may require up to a few Tb/s []. The transmission of such holograms may be underpinned by using data compression techniques, but even then, holograms are likely to require vast amounts of bandwidth. Therefore, latency and reliability become two critical key performance indicators (KPIs) for HT. Within Metaverse, HT will be able to launch a number of human-type communications, includ- ing telesurgery, immersive education, teleoperations, and the Internet of Skills (IoS) []. Due to HT’s high sensitivity to latency, these applications have strict requirements for round-trip delay. Thus, it is important that the communication link for these applications be ultra-reliable to avoid packet losses which may lead to disastrous events. To overcome that, mobile B5G/6G networks have been considering URLLC as one of the new application scenarios to support the above applications []. It is expected that with 5G New Radio, the radio access networks (RANs) can achieve a  ms delay with --- packet loss probability. This includes . ms uplink transmission and . ms downlink transmission []. In addition to that, 6G can provide URLLC with  Tbps of data rate and E2E delay of .1ms using THz frequency bands to support HT in Metaverse. V. NEXUS OF AI AND 6G FOR METAVERSE This section outlines the interplay of B5G/6G and AI towards Metaverse. In Section V-A, we discuss the role of 6G in realising the pervasive and ubiquitous AI services that are discussed in Section III for Metaverse environments. Section V-B explains the role of AI in making autonomous 6G network infrastructures for Metaverse, followed by the joint role of AI and 6G for tactile and immersive experiences FIGURE . An illustration of a large-scale SAGSIN in Realizing Metaverse. A. 6G-DRIVEN PERVASIVE AI FOR METAVERSE Metaverse is envisioned to be extending people’s life by allowing them to live, work, and play seamlessly for unlim- ited durations. This can only be realized if the Metaverse has a strong relationship with “ubiquitous connectivity with intelligence,” i.e., B5G/6G, AI, and space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN) as shown in Figure . In essence, 6G will support pervasive intelligence by reducing the potential latency of virtual experiences and will allow developers to develop better virtual experiences in the Metaverse where millions of concurrent users can share an immersive 3D space with each other. In such cases, the location of sender and receiver might be remote; thus, the challenge is to support dense connections (e.g.,  users/km2), where multiple users can transmit and receive ◦ video content or real-time human-like holographs in parallel [], []. Such a sheer amount of data fidelity will require ultra-high bandwidth with heterogeneous hardware for hosting AI services discussed in Section III, requir- ing extremely low-latency communications for transferring model parameters or performing AI inferences. Since 5G’s rollout, the first set of promising technologies along with architectural evaluation were polar codes, massive MIMO, mmWave, and MEC. These unique 5G services were able to support AR/VR applications by providing ubiquitous connectivity. AR/VR users leveraged 5G-eMBB service to achieve <100ms latency with a throughput of -200Mbps []. Several experiments were carried out further to evaluate 5G’s performance in realistic mobile envi- ronments. For example, the 5G-PPP (The 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership, ) consortium reported a data rate of approximately 3Gbps having 2ms of latency on their Bari-Matera installation in Italy. This experiment was carried out with the combination of 5G services with LTE technology. Another experiment provides data from around  trials and investigations conducted by the European 5G Observatory. In this scenario, the trials were conducted for a number of weeks in urban areas of Finland, therefore possibly with a reasonable density of users, and results suggest that the most realistic data rate was approximately ranged from  Mbps to  Gbps. According to the final experiment results, users’ devices realized  to . Gbps in average data rates, with less than  ms latency. It has widely been acknowledged that AR/VR applications require latency lower than 5ms, with average throughput between  Mbps to a few Gbps, and reliability of at least %, meaning that 5G performance is sufficient to support these needs []. . https://5g-ppp.eu/5g-trials-/ . https://www.fastweb.it/fastweb-plus/digital-magazine/5g-matera- . http://www.barimatera5g.it/ ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE FIGURE .

This shortcoming of 5G can be overcome by 6G, which is expected to provide ubiquitous global coverage as shown in Figure . As part of 6G systems, data collection, transportation, and utilization will take place in real-time and anywhere at any given time, hence, catalyzing immersive applications and services for Metaverse. 6G will particularly emphasize ubiquitous AI, bringing artificial general intelligence into every aspect of Metaverse through a hyper-flexible architecture. On top of that, a 6G network will be well suited for several Metaverse applications involving deep learning because it can generate a great deal of data and perform computation and storage at the network edge []. In summary, 6G networks can not only host personalized AI services but also cater to the needs of dense user connectivity with low-latency-high-reliability communica- tions. For instance, a case study by Adeogun et al. entails a framework involving a short-range wireless isochronous time (WIRT) environment for a 6G communication system. Authors developed a WIRT in-X sub-network with roundtrip communication latency lesser than .1ms with an outage probability < − []. A multi-GHz spectrum for enhancing spatial service availability is considered part of a dense IoT scenario with up to two devices per m2. Based on their results, it can be observed that cycle times are 10x shorter than the latency target achieved via 5G radio technology, i.e., <.1ms []. Therefore, Metaverse services involving novel communication modalities such as A2A, A2H, and H2A can leverage great benefits from 6G. We present a clear taxonomy of state-of-the-art for 5G/6G wireless-empowered immersive experiences in Figure . B. AI-LED AUTONOMOUS 6G NETWORKS FOR The success of the Metaverse experience will highly rely on the seamless and sustainable integration of physical space into virtual 3D space. Modern technologies (i.e., XR, AI, and 6G) can contribute to the interconnected Metaverse by ensuring interoperable coherence between the Metaverse and the physical world (e.g., physical objects in the real world are compatible with virtual objects in the Metaverse) []. In this regard, a minor disconnect between Metaverse and the physical world can cause only a mere disturbance to the users; however, as the prevalence and utility of Metaverse increases, such a disconnect in immersion may leave a long- lasting impact on the life-critical applications of Metaverse. Therefore, a communication system for Metaverse must be capable of providing a stress-free and extremely reliable Based on the above-discussed Metaverse requirements in is critical for 6G networks to have an intelligent and autonomous adjustment capability in order to meet various performance requirements, such as full coverage sensing, ultra-low latency, and ultra-high reliability, and persistent security []. At present, there is difficulty in dynamically adapting to the continual changes in user needs and network environments that alter the operating paradigms of today’s networks, which mainly rely on rule- based algorithms as their core. A further constraint is the inability to effectively accumulate the QoE of network operations, which in turn prevents continuous improvement in the capabilities of the network []. In other words, is not currently possible for networks to self-evolve under the existing operating procedures. Thereby, whenever there is a need to upgrade or improve something, much human expertise and effort are needed. As 6G networks grow in geography and complexity, manual intervention is unacceptable and unreliable for the networks to operate at such a scale. Therefore, to overcome this hurdle, european telecommunications standards institute (ETSI) recently initi- ated  groups, i.e., zero-touch service management (ZSM) and experiential networked intelligence (ENI), having focused on the use of ML and DL to manage and orchestrate the resources of a network in a fully automated way. The key objective of ZSM and ENI is to add the component of “intelligence” into every block of future networks in order to realize intelligent and self-evolution abilities within the The inception of Metaverse will exceptionally pose new challenges for 6G networks that will require support from AI, particularly deep reinforcement learning, and deep federated learning as shown in Figure . In the traditional sense, the Metaverse is not like a digital twin, which is a virtual repre- sentation serving as the equivalent to a physical object []. In essence, Metaverse will offer possibilities for scenario creation that differ from reality and allow them to be run at their own time and with their own rules, requiring dynamic support from 6G and AI nexus. As such, several researchers have already explored the use of AI for supporting 6G networks in challenging environments. For example, . https://www.etsi.org/committee/zsm . https://www.etsi.org/committee/ENI FIGURE . FL architecture and distributed training procedure in Metaverse. dutch double auction mechanism and DRL were combined in [] to improve transaction efficiency in the Metaverse. The ability to make intelligent decisions based on RL is a key enabler for the development of 6G networks for Metaverse, especially those with strict QoS requirements. Metaverse services can benefit from RL optimization techniques if they are well designed because they enable the ability of self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-organizing for the 6G networks. For instance, Tariq et al. propose a DRL- driven approach for proactive resource management and intelligent service provisioning in 6G networks for a digital- twin application []. However, this approach can suffer from a significant deficiency in the performance of AI models. Particularly, for a highly distributed Metaverse application where users are only supposed to interact continuously the other user’s data due to strict security restrictions as shown in Figure . To retain the performance of such AI models, recently Kang et al. proposed an architecture for a decentralized Metaverse application based on federated learning integrated with blockchain []. Based on their architecture, the local AI model can be optimized by horizon- tal cooperation of multiple end nodes (edge devices), which eventually retain the performance of AI models over time. Hence, the use of AI to optimize the network architecture and improve the performance of 6G networks is therefore proving to be a promising means of enhancing the Metaverse experience. In Figure , we present a clear taxonomy of state-of-the-art for AI-driven immersive experiences over C. AI AND 6G FOR TACTILE INTERNET IN METAVERSE In the Metaverse, the tactile Internet will dominate haptic communication for mission-critical virtual services with ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE FIGURE . Taxonomy for the classiﬁcation of literature on AI-empowered Immersive Wireless Experiences. touch and actuation in real-time while facilitating timeliness of information delivery for intelligent and interconnected meta-worlds. TI is expected to underpin human-to-human and human-to-machine interactions in a way that the time duration between actions and feedback should be much lower than the physical world reaction times []. For this reason, it is necessary that the TI has a 1ms delay due to the nature of the haptic signals and how humans perceive them. There is, however, a limit to the latency that can be supported by pre-5G networks, which is approximately 25ms []. Therefore, B5G/6G networks are anticipated to outperform previous generations in terms of performance by providing a sustainable infrastructure that will ultimately realize the TI for immersive services. 5G can aid in TI realization for Metaverse by addressing the key communication and computation challenges leveraging the following  important enabling technologies: edge computing, network func- tions virtualization (NFV), and software-defined networking (SDN) []. These enabling technologies can be combined in order to provide sophisticated solutions for the network architecture. For instance, researchers in [], [] explore how SDN can be leveraged efficiently for the edge computing based 5G networks. In another study by Aijaz et al. [], authors investigate how edge computing, SDN, and NFV can be utilized to create a novel, sustainable and general-purpose 5G architecture to realize TI applications. In essence, their approach is motivated by the virtualization concept of NFVs, which can dynamically instantiate an end-to-end 5G network according to the user’s applications’ requirements. Therefore, it can be observed that bringing computing capabilities closer to the user equipment and using SDN to control it centrally (i.e., limiting intermediate nodes) can foster latency reduction through edge computing and SDN [], []. be limited to the context of 5G, as discussed above in relation to the Tactile Internet and 5G, but that it should take a broader position than that. Many research efforts are underway that aim to achieve the TI over other technologies (e.g., wireless communication with sub-GHz technology, wireless local area network (WLAN) and wireless body area network (WBAN), and combinations of technologies similar to these). Despite 5G’s potential to enable URLLC applications in general, as mentioned in Section IV-A, its design objectives were not customized to the TI’s specific FIGURE . Summarization of Sustainable Metaverse. features and requirements. In response to the shortcomings of 5G, both industry and academia have gathered a great deal of interest in next-generation 6G systems, which are expected to support a variety of immersive applications from multi-sensory communication to XR []. Apart from that, TI lays out a sheer amount of opportunities to leverage AI, particularly deep learning to segregate the perception of humans from the overwhelming transmission delays which are usually experienced in wide area networks (WANs) []. AI can certainly play a key role in fulfilling the 1ms latency requirements using these networks. Although communication-based enabling technologies can overcome the end-to-end latency challenge, their efficiency can not go beyond the scope of 150km due to their dependency light. Therefore, deep learning-based predictions can be widely utilized to achieve 1ms latency by ruling out the 150km constraint on these networking VI. METAVERSE USECASES CONCERNING Metaverse with respect to virtual resources, virtual travel, digital twins, psychological barriers, and social sustainability, respectively. The issue of sustainability is at the helm of affairs when discussed business strategies concerning climate change. It is inevitable for the organizations to not think of a sustainable and efficient way for conducting business to make a positive impact on climate change. Although the concept of sustainability is not new, however, it needs to be evolved with respect to the innovation, changing times, and With the announcement of Metaverse, about carbon emissions and energy consumption were also raised as the commerce of Metaverse is solely based on cryptocurrencies. However, it has been highlighted by several the Metaverse holds potential for reducing carbon reductions through virtual physical with digital goods, and digital twins, respectively. it has also been suggested that Metaverse, through immersive experience, can help overcome behavioral hurdles concerning climate change. Most of the studies use sustainability in the context of environment, however, sustainability should also be addressed from social point of view. Metaverse can help in enhancing social sustainability by bringing equity, inclusive- ness, and accessibility on the table. It is the responsibility of the businesses and all stackholders involved to develop strategies and utilize Metaverse for improving both the environmental and social sustainability, respectively. This section briefly discusses the correlation between sustain- ability and Metaverse with the use of Digital-Twins and Industry .. The topics covered in this subsection are A. VIRTUAL RESOURCES IN METAVERSE The core assumption and intuition of Metaverse being digital alternatives as a substitute for real-world experiences and physical goods. It is assumed that the virtual experi- ences and digital products will be carbon-efficient and less resource-intensive in comparison to their counterparts. A paradigm shift in terms of budget allocation from consumers have already been noticed that shows positive signs for a significant sustainability impact. For trade globally consumes . billion m3 of water while emitting . metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) []. If consumers opt for a digital denim for their avatars instead of buying the physical one, save substantial amount of water and carbon emissions. ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE According to a study from EY Future Consumer Index39 % of Metaverse consumers intend to buy digital items for their avatars in future rather than investing in physical items. The study [] suggested that the transition to virtual denim from physical one can reduce the CO2 emissions by % which is equivalent to annual water consumption and annual emissions of around 350K internal combustion of automobiles in America [], []. Considering that a digital transformation from a single product could impact the resource and carbon efficiencies in a significant way, it can be assumed that the Metaverse is a potential candidate to achieve the required environmental sustainability. B. TRAVELLING THROUGH METAVERSE Globally, air travel contributes to .% of CO2 emissions but it was cut in half due to the COVID19 pandemic []. the earliest applications of Metaverse was to conduct a virtual meeting with a realistic VR experience. Recently, virtual concerts (Metaverse-based concerts) was organized which was attended by thousands of people in a virtual world [] that indicates that both the business travel can be replaced by Metaverse to a certain degree. Furthermore, with such an immersive experience, companies and businesses can promote the work-from-home culture to cut CO2 emissions. Although, physical collaboration and personal presence is important and recreating a live gathering would not be as real in Metaverse as it is in physical world, we assume that the Metaverse is not here to completely replace it. Rather it can be considered as an effective tool to reduce complexity and expense of discre- tionary trips while maintaining environmental sustainability. Digital twins is the biproduct of emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and augment and virtual reality. With the satellite generated data, digital twin can transform the real-world entitites into virtual representations, hence propelling sus- tainability with respect to individuals, manufacturing assets, supply chains, and so forth. Digital twins and metaverse truly compliment each other with the specific characteristics. For instance, digital twins can simulate the interaction of company’s information systems, equipment, and instruments in the digital world with the participants/avatars created through metaverse technology. Imagine a virtual training in which participants are from third world countries. All of the participants joined virtually do not have access to the representations of complex systems but with the help of digital twins the virtual participants not only can interact but also add value to the training. In short, the digital twin technology can empower the metaverse as suggested in []. It has been established by some studies that digital twin is one of the foundations for developing industrial meta- verse [], []. Furthermore, Global Lighthouse network (GLN) released a recent white paper [] also highlighted the importance of digital twins in attaining sustainability for industries, manufacturing, and production plants, respec- tively. Currently, there are many applications streamlined that use digital twins to improve the environmental sustainability. For instance, European space agency is working towards a system that can represent Earth’s digital twin to study human activities and its impact on the climate. The simulation then be used for making policies to ensure the improvement in environmental sustainability. Similarly, using digital twin for supply chain and manufacturing can improve the optimization for logistics, traceability, energy, processes and material inputs, accordingly. Another example is that of LG Electronics, Republic of Korea, digital twin for simulating assembly line and performed its integration with real-time production to improve product quality by %, improve productivity by %, and reduce energy consumption by %, respectively. Similar example can be garnered from Procter and Gamble in China that improved warehouse operations by factoring in digital twin. The integration resulted in reduced logistic costs by %, inventory reduction by %, and improved the rate of delivery time, which currently stands at .% []. Many industries have already started to adapt digital to reduce energy and scrap usage that contribute directly to environmental sustainability []. twins have also been widely used for medical records, modeling data from wearable sensors and forecast individual’s health with respect best environmental sustainability in the field of building operations that could help in improving space utilization by %, human productivity is increased by %, maintenance and operational efficiency has been improved by %, and lastly carbon emission for a building can be reduced by around %, respectively [], [], []. In recent interviews, Michael Jansen the CEO of Cityzenith (that is involved in making smart and sustainable cities throughout the world) has argued that urban digital twins and real-world Metaverse are synonymous and therefore, Metaverse would help in dealing with multisystem simulation and visualization of buildings and environment in digital space. D. SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY WITH METAVERSE Most of the sustainability issues are centered towards its environmental aspect, however, Metaverse addresses the unsustainable social aspects of the physical world and coa- lesce social rights such as diversity, accessibility, and equity within its ecosystem. The same was recently highlighted by the Chief Diversity Officer, Maxine Williams by her statement “Diverse people shouldn’t just participate in the Metaverse as consumers; they should be its architects and builders as well.” Recently, a bloomberg report [] also . https://www.ey.com/en_gl/consumer-products-retail/future-consumer- . https://tech.fb.com/ideas///being-intentional-about-diversity- index-moving-out-of-brands-reach equity-and-inclusion-in-the-Metaverse/ highlighted this issue concerning CryptoPunk NFTs stating that the digital avatar prices varied based on skin color, gender, and race, accordingly. Companies like OvalEdge41 have identified the problem as unconcious bias which is quite similar to the ones associated with AI models. The company suggest to use metrics and comprehensive set of target goals for the data scientist to reduce the bias and increase accessibility in Web3. Furthermore, stakeholders, civil society organizations, academia, investors, regulators, and businesses need to collaborate on this matter to make the Metaverse more democratized instead only decentralized. E. SUSTAINABLE COMMUNICATION AND The fifth generation communication system was created with a lot of hype and ambition to bring ubiquitous connectivity to the users. In recent Mobile World Congress (MWC), vice president of distributed edge at VMware quoted that “5G is another phone in hands that is no different from LTE and 4G. The sixth generation communication system is about putting the focus back on humanity and sustainability.” The discussions on 6G always starts conversation in accordance to human, economic, and societal development. Furthermore, 6G emphasizes more on democratization instead of decen- tralization which is one of the major concerns with Metaverse and its coarse to sustainability. The sixth generation system is also being developed for achieving sustainability goals through better resource efficiency, less energy consumption, and less power requirement, accordingly. One of the driving forces for 6G advancement was the COVID- pandemic that made researchers and people realize about putting more emphasis on economic and societal needs of the broadband network instead of looking for nice presentation of devices and better performance. The 6G and metaverse are a good match for sustainable due to its characteristics of democratization and keeping human in the loop while breaking temporal and spatial barriers for multi-person F. METAVERSE SECURITY AND PRIVACY Metaverse is simply a digital embodiment of the real world. However, Metaverse collects information from the user that is real to the physical world such as facial features, eye movements, hand movements, credit card details, address, name, and so forth. The collection of such information raises security and privacy concerns and might put Metaverse user at risk. It is assumed by the experts that the Metaverse will be the prime target for the malicious actors and hackers for fraudulent processes. Additionally, Metaverse is also vulnerable to the spread of hate speeches and false information. A recent survey from Sprout43 . https://www.trendingtopics.eu/how-will-6g-and-the-metaverse- . https://sproutsocial.com/insights/metaverse-dangers/ conducted from  marketers suggest that % of them are concerned about safety and privacy of the data concerning Some of the recent studies have also highlighted the security, privacy, and ethical issues, concerning Metaverse. Pietro and Cresci [] highlighted several security and privacy concerns related to Metaverse along with their logical implications. The study also provides several research directions to address security and privacy concerns related to the technical and non-technical paradigms for the real- ization of Metaverse. Zhao et al. [] also highlighted the security concerns within the Metaverse ecosystem. However, the study divided the privacy and security concerns into four categories, i.e., Goods, Scenario, Communication, and user information. The goods in their study refers to the artworks, buildings, costumes, appearance, customized modeling of characters and personalized dress. Scenario is concerned with the religion, culture, and platform aspects. Communication reflects the understanding, mutual cooperation, sharing, sociality, and interactivity aspects. Lastly, the user category considers the fusion of data acquired from multiple sensors and the collection of information. The information can be social, biometric, physical, or physiological, respectively. Gupta et al. [] highlighted the privacy and security issues in the Metaverse in the context of service providers, stakeholders, and platforms. In addition, the study also provides ideas to handle security and privacy issues through the use of Zero-Trust Architecture and its integration with Metaverse system. Huang et al. [] in their work, explored the expandability, real world-building, and socialization characteristics of the Metaverse. While discussing the economic aspects of the aforementioned char- acteristics, the study also highlights the privacy and security risks including insecure design, broken authentication, data injections, phishing, unauthorized access, eavesdropping, information leakage issues. The study also raised concerns related to humanity and society in the context of the Metaverse. Wang et al. [] presented a systematic literature survey of studies carried out address privacy and security concerns in the metaverse. In addition, the study aligns the security and privacy aspects with heterogeneity, sustainability, hyper spatiotemporality, and immersive realism, which are the main characteristics associated with the Metaverse. The study also delves into the potential research directions that could be helpful for coping with the security issues. Some of the prominent security, ethics, and privacy concerns in the Metaverse are highlighted One of the main ethical concerns in the Metaverse is related to the ownership and digital rights of the assets and creations that are built within the digital realm. Other ethical concerns include the accessibility and inclusivity of the individuals from diverse backgrounds so that they can participate in the ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE Metaverse with equal rights. One of the concerns regarding inclusivity is that of cyberbullying and virtual harassment, which needs to be addressed in the Metaverse ecosystem. the fairness and algorithm biases concerning the methods and platforms used for the creation of digital realm in Metaverse needs to be responsible for avoiding any user Similar to the economic system and applications in the real world, virtual world is also vulnerable to hackers and thieves that are looking to target the assets such as virtual currency, rare virtual items and virtual real estate, in the Metaverse. The malicious users can exploit system vulnerabalities to theft. Therefore, securing the virtual assests needs to be addressed within the Metaverse before the tactic to convince an individual for revealing their sensitive information is referred to as social engineering. The same tactic can be exploited convincingly with the persuasive interactions and design of avatars. Such tactics by hackers can be used to make the user reveal their identity, financial, or personal information, which could lead In digital world, the hackers or malicious users can pass on the links to malicious softwares and viruses, which can put not only their digital footprint but also the information in the physical world at risk. Furthermore, the click to the links in virtual world while interacting with the digital objects is quite ubiquitous and persuasive in comparison to its physical Data breach issue is one of the most prominent ones in the physical world, therefore, Metaverse will be implicitly vulnerable to such an attack making it the ground zero for attackers and hackers. Hackers trying to gain access to your personal photos, and information via the virtual platform needs to be addressed before the large scale realization of One of the highlights of the Metaverse is that the ecosystem is decentralized suggesting that no central authority is incharge for the control and regulation of virtual environ- ment. It allows the users with high degree of autonomy and freedom. However, the same characteristics can also be used for causing harm to the users as there is no account- ability or oversight to the content being created, posted, or VII.

All of the aforementioned meth- ods have been used in some capacity or another to make the visualization of images/frames better and unique. Recently, large-language models such as Dall-E2 [] has taken the Internet by storm with the creation of realistic images via language understanding. It will help not only with the creation of scintillating art but also unique visual experience In simple words, circular economy is all for producing waste and circulating materials and products in order to preserve nature. Although many companies have move towards eco- friendly products but the impact is not substantial. We have discussed as to how the travel reduces CO2 emissions. In  alone, the conference and exhibition industry was estimated to be . trillion dollars of worth, which requires substantial travel. Metaverse can help reduce the air travel by making the exhibition and conference industry digital/virtual, which will not only help in achieving sustainable develop- ment goals but will also help in cost savings for both the parties, hence a more circular approach []. Similarly, a game could be designed that can motivate the consumers for not using plastic items and using recycled products for minting a fraction of a coin (mining approach). It has been suggested by researchers as well as industry that Metaverse can help in improving overall sustainability []. It can be the motivation for users to opt for digital clothing, virtual concerts, virtual meetings, and so forth. If used the right way, achieving sustainability through Metaverse would be inevitable. However, it could be used otherwise to disrupt the sustainability goals, therefore, regulations, guidelines and laws needs to be made and enforced for making the Metaverse a savior. Furthermore, the use of digital twins has already proven to be a positive way towards sustainability. In addition, the Metaverse also need to work on social sustainability so that the virtual system could achieve democratization instead of only moving ) LAYERED SECURITY IN METAVERSE Metaverse is without a doubt a game changer but with the would increase manifold as the Metaverse move toward commercialization. For instance, a successful business deal can turn to a disaster if the avatar (person) is impersonating someone else. Therefore, a layered security will be essential to secure the data as well as AI methods in Metaverse.

In such cases, 6G networks allow slicing of the network into multiple virtual and standalone logical networks while sharing a same physical infrastructure [], []. Thus, each network slice can be customised to serve a Metaverse application in an efficient way by taking care of the energy efficiency, latency, dense connectivity, mobility, and bandwith. A key feature of 6G networks will be the provisioning of network slices in a dynamic manner []. Rather than categorizing Metaverse applications into eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC as in the traditional networks, 6G networks will be capable of providing dynamic types of service depending on the network traffic and the user ) SELF-SUFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN METAVERSE Existing communication and computing infrastructures are limited in terms of scaling the services and applica- tions according to dynamic requirements. As an example, Facebook space (a VR-based social network), is only able it provides. Metaverse will bring many essential use cases for which this is inefficient, ing virtual classrooms, holoconferences and events, and virtual tourism [], [], [], []. With the advent of decentralised intelligence, multi-access edge computing, microservices, and reinforcement learning techniques, a ray of optimism shines through the way for such immersive applications [], [], [], []. A Metaverse environment supported by 6G networks will be made more responsive by automating the wireless networks with advanced deep learning methods. In particular, 6G combined with the incredible capabilities of reinforcement potential to truly transform the existing infrastrcture and making them suitable for Metaverse environments. Moreover, implementing AI as a native function of the network will enable 6G to become the first-generation network to promote large-scale deployment of self-optimized and automated networks [], []. As a result of the latest advances in aforementioned technologies, practices, and methods, future wireless networks will be able to co-exist according to their state and achieve the goals set for them.

This subsection highlights foreseeable challenges and future directions concerning the role of AI in Metaverse. ) INTEGRATION WITH EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES It is apparent from the growth of Metaverse that more and more users will explore and adapt to the aforementioned technology. In order to handle scalablility, Metaverse needs to integrate with emerging technologies such as 5G/6G, Industry ., Internet of Aerial and Ground Vehicles, and so forth. The repercussions or issues that may arise from such integration are yet to be seen but we can assume that the heterogeneity, bandwidth management, energy efficiency, and security would be a few of them. Metaverse is known for realistic and immersive experience in digital world. However, as the marketplace gets saturated, the users will demand for unique aspects such as new digital landscapes, more interactive spaces, experiences based on reality, and real-time emotion mapping in digital world. Few of the aforementioned issues can be handled by large language models and methods like Dall-E, but these models and methods are not publicly accessible. Furthermore, the usage of these models cannot be handled by hand-held devices, therefore, the challenge of designing platforms that could provide mutual services and solutions will be in dire From the review of seminal works, it has been revealed that the Metaverse is far from being democratized at this point. With the growing and diverse users, Metaverse will have to opt for democratization in order to maintain sustainability. Researchers have suggested to use AI-based smart contracts to detect anomalies, but that is yet to be achieved, and the outcomes are yet to be realized. AI is itself subjected to biases, therefore, humans in the loop for making the process of democratization bias free needs to be integrated. ) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PRESERVATION Metaverse has been mainly introduced as an extension of our reality. This extension brings forth the businesses challenges in the real-world such as brand protection, copyright issues, theft of intellectual property and more. Due to being in a digital space, the counterfeiting in Metaverse would be much easier, and reproducibility of the trademarks cheaper. The challenges for this category are not only related to AI, but also the law enforcement agencies and intellectual filing offices. Furthermore, methods needs to be devised to confront anonymity in the Metaverse as it will hinder the most for content and brand owners to enforce their This subsection highlights foreseeable challenges and future directions concerning the role of B5G/6G in Metaverse. ) MASSIVE, HIGHLY DYNAMIC, AND COMPLEX It is beyond question that Metaverse will be build on top of the highly dynamic, massively dense, and exception- ally complex mobile networks. These networks will be composed of ultra-large scale and inherently heterogeneous equipments. There are, however, many features that are fixed in the architecture of current wireless networks, and the optimization tasks are thus defined to address particular challenges and services that have been identified and defined in advance [], []. Consequently, existing process of manually optimizing and configuring networks is not suitable for the Metaverse. Further, original 5G service classes will be challenged by new immersive experiences such XR gaming, teleoperations, and holographic telepresense that will become available soon in the context of Metaverse []. Therefore, future mobile networks have to simultaneously deliver high transmission rates, high reliability, and low latency in order to effectively provide aforementioned Metaverse services. ) ZERO-TOUCH MANAGEMENT FOR METAVERSE Future wireless networks for Metaverse will not rely on manual interventions to avoid any minacious possibilities. Hence, ZTM will play a useful role by controlling, mon- itoring, and configuring the tasks for massive networks FIGURE . Some KPIs and requirements for evaluating the immersiveness in a to attain a fully independent closed-loop automation by alleviating any opportunities of human intervention []. In current wireless networks, ZTM has been enabled for specific 5G/6G usage scenarios []. However, Metaverse will expose diverse requirements occurring from heterogeneous user application. Hence it demands for a universal ZTM the requirements of several verticals in ) SPACE-AIR-GROUND-SEA COVERAGE FOR The space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network will empower Metaverse in two folds: • Non-terrestrial networks will provide ubiquitious wire- less access to users from anywhere at anytime []. • Terrestrial networks will support Metaverse users to hop freely among space-air-ground-sea intergrated networks for an uninterrupted immersive experience [], []. However, the highly frequent fidelity of momentous data among space-air-ground-sea can cause significant delays requiring massive bandwith and overwhelming backhaul it becomes imperative to explore new SAGSIN architectures and simulation platforms to underpin the diverse and extensive services and applications of Metaverse. Further, reliability could be compromised in existing SAGSIN architectures due to highly mobile nature of satellites which may eventually cause disrup- tion to Metaverse applications. Hence, novel evaluation metrics are needed to be designed for future services of Metaverse, as proposed by researchers in []. Figure  shows some of the requirements for seamless meta-immersion and indicators to evaluate the performance ) TACTILE FEEDBACK IN METAVERSE It has been discussed in Sections IV-D and V-C that certain applications of Metaverse, such as robotic surgery, avatar- to-avatar interaction, teleoperations, and telepresence need to rely on every tiny bits of tactile information occuring from the interaction between physical and meta environment ZAWISH et al.: AI AND 6G INTO THE METAVERSE in order to function normally. Although IEEE introduced a standard for tactile Internet (IEEE P1918.) to normalize such activities, however, the requirements of tactile feedback are ultra-low latency such as in milliseconds []. The existing 5G-URLLC usecases are expected to meet these requirements. Irrespective of that, the tactile Internet poses a number of potential research challenges that have yet to be fully addressed, particularly in the context of Metaverse. delivering tactile information can be proposed for Metaverse usecases []. In addition to that, intelligent and adaptive network traffic management can be explored for delivering multi-sensory audio-visual tactile information over wireless networks. Lastly, the computing capabilities can be acceler- ated for immersive services by apply compression techniques as pro-processors for tactile information. C. INTEGRATED ROLE OF AI AND 6G IN METAVERSE This subsection highlights foreseeable challenges and future directions concerning the integrated role of AI and 6G in ) 6G-ENABLED EDGE AI IN METAVERSE It is anticipated that Metaverse will bring a complete shift of AI from cloud to the network edge, hence achieving on-device intelligence for Metaverse services. Edge AI can certainly benefit Metaverse in achieving low latency response while ensuring privacy of the user’s data [], [], []. However, the offloading of Metaverse services will pose severe challenges for the existing wireless networks. For instance, Metaverse users based in remote regions with poor Internet connectivity might face a disconnect due to high latency. For mission-critical applications, this latency can potentially lead to worse consequences. Hence, modern communication systems can leverage 6G-uMBB services to support Metaverse applications on the end devices []. Edge caching can also be explored to further reduce the transmission latency. Furthermore, Metaverse will enable collection of sheer amount of hetrogenous data (due to diverse users/services), hence edge devices can leverage the federated learning to perform model training locally without violating any privacy laws as shown in Figure . ) AI-BASED NETWORK AUTOMATION FOR METAVERSE In a Metaverse composed of heterogeneous users and services, the network automation will be of key importance for delivering seamless QoE to users. AI has to play a vital role in enabling self-adaptive capabilities in 6G networks. Recently, AI-based frameworks have been widely used for empowering automation in 6G networks by allowing them to self-allocate, self-configure and self-optimise the network equipment and resources []. However, as anticipated in these abilities can be hindered by following • Lack of labeled training data to update the AI model • The complexity of underlying deep learning models to be ported on resource-constrained devices • The limitation in availability of hardware to support new and emerging intelligent services for Metaverse To address the aforementioned challenges, the possible research directions would be to adapt self-supervision learn- ing techniques for training AI models, and distributing the AI models in the end-edge-cloud continuum to alleviate the computational load on end/edge devices. ) ENERGY EFFICIENT AI AND 6G FOR METAVERSE Metaverse developers when proposing AI and 6G driven solutions. Based on the integrated role of AI and 6G, as discussed in Section V, it can be said that both will be highly utilized for delivery of immersive services in Metaverse while tackling the density and mobility of users. However, in order to meet the Metaverse requirements for ubiquitous intelligence from anywhere at anytime, 6G networks will require abundant resources and their maintenance []. While some of the resources might be highly leveraged, the others will rather remain redundant or unutilized most of the time, hence consuming the equivalent energy. To address this, network resources should be either adaptive or designed specifically according to the energy requirements of a certain Metaverse application [], []. Moreover, since most of the intelligence will be hosted locally, it will consume relatively higher energy than cloud-based intelligence, and will eventually cause the batteries to drain faster. In such the end devices should be capable of harvesting energy from their surroundings in order to remain self- sufficient []. Apart from that, modern AI models require significant energy for their execution due to their nature of being highly parameterised. Therefore, a potential research direction would be to either remove the redundant parameters from AI models by trading the accuracy or adaptively offload the models to edge or cloud based on the intermittent energy D. TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE METAVERSE This subsection highlights the foreseeable challenges and future directions concerning sustainable Metaverse. Although the Metaverse has the potential to reduce carbon emissions, substantially through the virtual if used improperly. For instance, with the emergence of Metaverse, there would be a need to powerup data centers, thus the companies adopting Metaverse would need to shift to hyperscale data centers for meeting energy demands. Furthermore, most of the ecommerce associated with Metaverse is performed through NFTs and blockchain based processes which is an energy intensive process. Metaverse would need to move towards proof-of-stake where the transactions are concerned as they are less energy intensive. Furthermore, AI can be used to optimize the efficiency gains while proof-of-stake transactions are performed to further lower the energy consumption. Studies have suggested that certain part of societies have better access to technology, therefore, the introduction to new technology in the market foster homogeneity instead of diversity. For instance, statista reported that Western Europe and North America makes up almost  percent of the VR set sales. Very recently, PR Newswire suggested that North America will be the epicenter of Metaverse growth in next four years. In order for Metaverse to be compliant with sustainable development goals, forward towards equitable distribution of the technology, thus, lowering the digital divide in the digital world. Currently, the Metaverse is considered to be an extension of our reality or a digital space which is not dependent on the current mental state. However, continuous exposure and overuse of the Metaverse can create societal implications such as creating a parallel reality that affects the mental state and well-being of an individual. In order to make Metaverse sustainable, it needs to undergo governance and audit, so that an individual’s mental state should not be overwhelmed and the individual’s perception of digital world, i.e., Metaverse should be disjoint from its physical state, accordingly. The Metaverse not only collects two-dimensional Internet data but also the three dimensional environment data, which, if leaked can have serious implications in the physical world. Furthermore, the Metaverse enables the users to create their multiple personalities which can elevate the challenge of security and privacy to manifold. The use of AI and blockchain for not only managing personalities, identities but also that governance, data ownership, authentication and transactions needs to be undertaken. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review on the role of AI and 6G in realising the immersive experiences of Metaverse. In particular, we investigated several underlying technologies of AI and 6G, such as advancements in computer vision, learning paradigms, and wireless commu- nication technologies in the context of Metaverse. Besides that, we explore the joint role of AI and 6G technologies in obtaining ubiquitous intelligence, tactile feedbacks, and self-optimising capabilities for several Metaverse services . https://www.statista.com/statistics//ar-vr-headset-sales-share- . https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/Metaverse-market--of- ranging from holographic telepresence to remote surgeries. the sustainable aspect of Metaverse services followed by the applications, usecases, and on-going projects. Lastly, we enlighten numerous open issues, future directions, and lessons learned for potential researchers and developers of Metaverse applications and services. [] L. U. Khan, Z. Han, D. Niyato, E.
